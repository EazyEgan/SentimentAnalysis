"People will always ask the same question ""Will this 2K game be worth it this year?"". My answer to that, is yes. While 2K has struggled over the past few years to finally find it's mark with games, this game is totally different from your normal 2K WWE game. This game has it's own style and it clearly shows within the game. The only real downside of this game would be the need to unlock every superstar and the lack of content. 2K as always has payable coins in game to unlock superstars. You can either put in a bunch of hours to unlock each and every superstar or go out the quick way and just buy them. However, this does not take away from the breath of fresh air this game brings to the table. 2K has stepped it up by giving us a fresh fun video game. There is no realism in this game, it is a very arcade/superpower packed game. This is a game every wrestling fan should pick up due to the fresh air this game brings to the world of wrestling games.",1,0,en

"To make it simple, Rider of Tomb Raider is very very Tomb Raider and above all a good Action-Adventure. The first thing that will jump in your eyes is the graphic prowess even for 2019. The exploration aspect is more present than in the previous opus by its environment still semi-open world but with larger areas with more points of interest. 'interests. The gameplay is still dynamic and new mechanics are integrated to make travel more diverse. The leveling is not really useful and on some point too useful but enough to give an impression of evolution. The scenario is in no way neglected, he knew, at least for me, keep me in suspense all along the game. Like almost all Tomb Raiders, I recommend it!",1,0,en

"Rememoried is a first-person adventure game, focused on the ideas of dreams and memories with surrealistic, explorative and puzzle-solving settings. The way you advance in the game is by looking away from your surroundings, elements in the environment, and other important objects for they’ll constantly change shape and create a new path. “You count the stars above your head just like the one who pointed a finger at you from the unknown. The closer you get to infinity, the more you get lost in the numbers created to describe the real world, and your eyelids become curtains that hide unexpected discoveries beyond the borders, reached by only the strongest thoughts. This exciting play for one spectator is a reward for everyday gifts of the mind.” The game is visually stunning, along the sound of flowing water combined with the elegant classical and eerie electronic music.  This combined with a breathtaking environment makes the game incredibly relaxing if you just explore and don’t focus on the objective. At times the game can be frustrating or difficult to discover what your objective is for a specific level.  All individually difficult to figure out which requires patience to get into its mechanics yet not impossible to beat them.   But overall, I still had a blast playing through this small indie title. A beautiful game with an equally relaxing soundtrack! Definitely worth a try!  9/10",1,0,en

"My PC:  OS: Windows 10 64-bit CPU: I3-6100  GPU: Radeon R9 380 4GB Storage: SSD  Review This is not my first dance at the rodeo. Nor is it my first sandbox experience. Having platinumed the PS Vita version of Terraria, and having tried virtually all of the other sandbox experiences out there (many of them merely watered down derivatives of the genre-leaders) I can't say I was massively enamoured with the thought of sinking more time into another. I was a little jaded, tbh.  However, I'm glad I did. Because Crea has certainly been worth my time so far. The graphics are simple but functional, the music isn't to my taste but I can turn it off without having to mute it in the volume mixer, and the game runs stable even if it could do with better optimisation.  If you, like me, you have run the gamut of sandboxes, then you'll basically know what you'll be getting into, with the pleasant exception that the devs have clearly put some thought (and work) into Crea. The lore, the levelling, the intuitive controls (using a Xbox 360 controller at least), the crafting and the overall experience.  And an actual working (and coherent) tutorial - hallelujah! The combat is fast-paced and frantic.  The crafting is logical and varied.  The levelling is Skyrim-esque.  Would I recommend it?  Definitely, the game as it is is worthy of your time and money, and the post-release roadmap, if it can be realised, looks particularly intriguing.  Rating 7/10 (for now) Pros: Fun sandbox gameplay with an actual twist, RPG flavoured.  Mod support.  Controller support / Configurable controls Frequent updates / bug-fixes.  Ongoing support / updates.  Cons: Graphics are little more than functional. Not a fan of the music.  Could benefit from greater optimisation (though dev has indicated that this will be forthcoming).  Time-sink (con for a new dad!).  Loading times.  Disclaimer I received this product for free from the Developer in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1,0,en

"First of all, congratulations for the release. It's been a long wait, we've always wanted a port and now here it is.  Thank you, Nightdive. There are many new additions in FS and I appreciate them (MP support with Steam friends without the need for the host's IP is perfect). However, there are a few things I'd like to be added/changed: 1) enemies and secrets counter like in BloodGDX, perhaps even a timer like nBlood offers 2) fix the issues with custom addons (Blood Trauma Therapy does not load, for example) 3) show info about the savefile in the load save screen like BloodGDX does (map, difficulty, date and so on) 4) this is a nitpick, but would there be a way to include a builtin map editor for the game? Sorta like a Windows port of mapedit.exe 5) show map name and creator at the beginning of the level, like BloodGDX does 6) implement a way to continue to the next episode after you've finished the previous one without the need to go to the main menu 7) disable retrieval of custom nickname from Steam when in a MP game (because if you have a custom nickname set for the friend you're playing with, FS will show the whole thing including the nickname and it overlaps with your own name if that nickname is too long) or perhaps include a setting so you can choose between the Steam name and your custom one for your friend 8) fix the warped graphics when you set FOV ~>90 or 100 9) fix the freezing when you save your game 10) implement trading cards and badges please 11) autosave and let us just press enter twice to save instead of having to rewrite the savefile name every single time 12) ability to delete savefiles or mark (show a warning) those with cheats on/disabled achievements and display a note for the savefiles that have been made by jumping to a specific map instead of playing the entire episode; perhaps even custom notes would be nice 13) on E2M6, if you enable ""i wanna be like kevin"" cheat and fall all the way down, the gargoyles will always die and fall after they fly around for a while 14) add new HUD styles, like the minimal but smart one from nBlood",1,0,en

"I'd forgotten how good the early Call of Duty games were. I was originally more into the early Men of Honor game (and other FPS games)   until I played the second Call of Duty, which really grabbed my attention far more than the early MOH games, at least when I first played it.  Despite  the  linear nature of both franchises at the time, the early COD games felt less linear than  the MOH games (IMO)  I didn't actually  buy it when it was first released because I was really into  Battlefield Vietnam, Vietcong, Line of Sight: Vietnam, Men of Valor, Battlefield 2 and America's Army at the time  and just didn't have the time to play another FPS game, especially considering I was  big into  playing online with friends  regularly (almost daily) and co-ran  a small  gaming clan called 'The Pointmen' and administered their  web site.   It was only when I  got a demo of the game via  one of those gaming  magazines that I realised how good the game was and immediately purchased a copy from my local game store.   I'm sure most  community members into first person shooters will have already played this game at some time  over the years since its release; however, if you haven't you should really pick this game up at the first opportunity, though I recommend waiting  for  a Steam sale as  I do think, considering its age it is now over priced at £14.99.  You can pick up a PC hard  copy via eBay for  a few   quid/dollars.  (I saw a Call of Duty 2 with Call of Duty World at War  (my favourite) for less than  £5  with free postage  I'm still working through the  Russian missions and so far have made it through the pipes to the rail yard  and am presently  retaking the train station. This game in parts reminds me of one of my favourite  Stalingrad films 'Enemy at the Gates' starring Jude Law, Ed Harris and one of my favourite actors Ron Perlman.  The main aim is to  clear each area of   German troops, though  there are other missions included such as repairing  telegraph wires, knocking out artillery and  most stages so far have  require you to plant   bombs on enemy tanks before you can proceed further.  Grenades are useless  against the tanks, but the smoke grenades are very useful  to  create a screen, enabling you to move up to  the target tank  unseen, though usually you do need to make sure you've cleared away  as many of the OpFor as possible.  Use the smoke grenades sparingly as you can only carry four at a time and resupplies   only occur  (at least for the smoke bombs) at the beginning of a new mission); grenades  are easier to come by and can often be found in enemy positions once you've cleared them out.  The beauty of COD2 compared to the first game  is that you get some warning of nearby grenades and their position in relation to your character Vassili (I'll talk about the other characters later once I've  progress to the American and British missions).  The second innovation was the regenerating health. Instead of having to pick up health packs;  so long as you stay out of the line of fire, or you don't get caught by the main blast of a grenade,  tank or artillery  shell you can regain your health over a short period.  If you are hit  badly  the screen will go red and   the sound of battle will fade into the distance and movement becomes sluggish. This  means less restarts from  the checkpoints you manage to pass.  Enemy positions  and  your targets are marked on the mini map that you can see in the bottom left of the screen.  Ammo and  grenades are indicated on the bottom right.  ; After playing  all but the latest   Battlefield  game and  the  zombie dlc's for Black Op's III, I  still prefer these older  FPS games to the  more modern and graphically superior games that have been released over the last decade apart from maybe   &  , but they're  more a simulation franchise as opposed to a run and gun FPS game like Call of Duty 2.    Too be honest, I can't really explain why I prefer these older games because I do  love the graphics and realism in the latest FPS games; however, I just get a better gut feeling and excitement  playing this older Call of Duty game as well as other older FPS games.  In fact, recently I've been replaying  quite  a few of my older  FPS games especially Battlefield Vietnam, Vietcong,  Men of Valour (MOV) and  Battlefield 2 (I'm still  getting new maps and have been testing  a great WWII mod that is yet to be released despite the game being released a couple of months before COD2  almost 15 years ago and can't believe  the game was removed from Steam some years ago).    Okay, Call of Duty 2 may be ancient as far as graphics go, but too be honest, it still looks pretty good considering its age and the graphic developments we've seen over the last 15 years.  The only other game that looks better from this period  is the 2004 Vietnam game,    (which has also  been available  via Steam for the past three years - oddly I'd just purchased 15 hard copies of MOV from a clearance sale  a week before it was released on Steam as I was intending to send them out to friends because I still love the multiplayer  part of MOV). I will finish this review once I've played the American and British campaigns, which could be a while as I'm  currently also playing  other early FPS games via hard copies i still have.",1,0,en

"It's hard for me to write paragraphs about this game so I'll just list my pros and cons.   *It's on Steam, complete with trading cards. *It's a pretty game with all the settings turned up, despite slight issues mentioned in the cons. *Lots of options for vehicles and customisation. Still no Toyotas though! *Day/Night cycles with dynamic weather, including different game modes for each. *Accessibility options are there for those that need them, like text to speech. *Crossplay between consoles and PC platforms ensures the playerbase isn't segregated. An outstanding move that should be done on every multiplayer game going forward. *Lots of content to play though even without DLC. *Cops are pretty aggressive this time around, compared to games like Payback. *Multiplayer mode is fun, albeit a bit jarring with the rubberbanding and teleporting cars.   *Handling model is still bad, with ""drift to turn"" being the only feasible way to go through corners most of the time. *The racing, while it can be challenging at times, isn't that fun. For some reason, there's no hype flying down a highway at 254km/h, or taking a corner perfectly at breakneck speeds. It feels like the racing gameplay lacks personality. *The game is pretty, sure, but there's some weird issues with the graphics. Textures look really muddy and low quality sometimes (probably a texture streaming issue). It also rains when there's no rainclouds in the sky lol. *The story is again, forgettable. Some of the characters have some decent backstories you can listen in on and figure out for yourself, but that's about it. I don't care much for these tryhard cops, who for some reason, ignore me during the daytime. *This might come down to personal taste, but I'm not enjoying the soundtrack at all. Not a bad game, but not a great one either. But I'll give it a plus for the polish and extra features. To this day, EA has not released a Need for Speed title that tops Most Wanted back in 2005.",1,0,en

"Well, I bought the game again during the sales and nabbed it for £16 (After having refunded it back in 2016 due to the fact my computer's processor back then was incompatible.) This was before Next was even announced so.. At the time the game was agreeable at that price, now I feel I have underpaid for it. I haven't played much of NMS but this new patch has kept me hooked. I'm calling it a day for now so I can eat some dinner and I can sleep on it, but it looks beautiful. There's purpose, I care about the story and the exploration for items and landmarks keeps you engaged. In my original review I wanted to compare NMS to Spore, however I would now compare it more to Breath of the Wild. This, in the way you explore and have this vast open world, galaxy, to explore and uncover everything about it is pretty familiar. We just need space horses now. I would love if in further patches it gave even more depth to this exploration, or more interaction with plants and animals. That would be sweet. They have overhauled the tutorial which guides you through your first system in a very hands off way, it doesn't force you to conform to some path they have set out for you. Of course, you land on the planet that has the signal on it, and beyond that you do whatever you want. Survival adds a nice spice of challenge which I appreciate. Having it easy doesn't sit so well, but you will get annoyed when you lose all your items.  The space stations as more lively, customisation is fun although I would love even more options and perhaps some call alternate legs that aren't just humanoid (but that's entirely me). I'm excited to explore beyond. Collecting animal and plants is fun and interesting. My first planet had some very interesting and sleek looking animals, and the birds are awesome.  There's so much more for me to witness as of yet, but at this point, this is the game we were asking for. The base building will be amazing once I can actually sink my teeth into it. Onwards and upwards. I'm sure it's been said too, but after two years I'm so glad I can change this review. --OLD REVIEW-- 13th August 2016 I requested a refund in the end because my pc couldn't run it. I'm not going to completely say the game is bad, but I can't recommend it. I've read a lot of things were cut out besides and it's a shame. I will be waiting until it is a little cheaper and then i might buy it again. The best comparison I have to this game is Spore. Did you like Spore?",1,0,en

"10 out of 10 Tomb Raider The Last Revelation is my favourite Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider 4 like the others has slightly enhanced graphics and sounds, but Lara’s mansion is not in TR4 instead you have a slight boring and non-skippable tutorial level. Lara doesn’t change her outfit this time around, but it does make TR4 feel like a complete game. The whole game is Set in Egypt she is on another gun blazing adventure. When Lara is exploring Egypt she discovers a lost temple and unwittingly unleashes an evil and power full curse across the land. Lara is going to need all her skills to stop Set and save to world from certain doom, do you have what it takes.",1,0,en

"One of the best innovative games , from its ecstatic environment of the city to the creepy eerie abandoned forest this game was a complete adventure. The controls for this game are some which I've never seen, getting the hang of it takes time.

"As you may know Ryse: Son of Rome came out on Xbox One on launch date about 11 months ago, now ported over to PC!  Info and what you should know:  - includes all 4 DLC packs on launch - 4K support (recommended Titan card) - solid PC port - Impressive graphics - There are a total of 8 missions (the average first run any % of the game should take between 4-7hrs) - For those wondering, multiplayer is co-op PvE ... not PvP Cons: (now these are not necessarily bad, but something I may have looked into) - execution animations are the same - enemies look the same - very few new mechanics after the first level Overall Summery: I would give this game an 8/10, the game looks and plays really smoothly, the story is excellent but only thing you'll start noticing after awhile is it's kind of repetitive with the killing. Watch my Let's Play Part 1 here: ( I cover the options menu/port and mission 1 of the story )",1,0,en

"It's hard not to recommend this game to your friends. I did skip the game for a long time because I thought it’s a pure pvp game, yet I couldn’t be more wrong. After I finally tried it, I couldn't take my eyes away from this masterpiece. The upcoming patches are just astonishing. Best free to play model I have ever come across, it's a game where you want to spend money to support the creators. I'm still learning and exploring new and amazing things in this game. The last thing what I also wanted to mention, is the main mission. I never thought I would be so touched by it, it really gave me a great feeling and bound to mine Warframes. I would recommend it to every player who played free to play MMO's, just to see how the cash shop can be made right. 10/10",1,0,en

"Writing a review immediately after finishing the game might not be the smartest idea, but the urge to do so being this strong says something in and of itself. Have you ever been pulled into a book in such a way that you couldn't put it aside at night, even though you knew you still had 400 pages left and wouldn't be able to finish them before you passed out from exhaustion? Hashihime of the Old Book Town recreates that experience, visual novel style. The story starts out innocent enough, but gradually twists and turns, until the reader is just as lost as the protagonist. But before I get into other details, I should mention the gameplay. As with most visual novels, there is not much “gameplay” to speak of, but the structure is a bit different than what you would usually see in this genre. While Hashihime does have multiple endings, it is mostly a kinetic visual novel. This might sound confusing, but it's actually rather simple, and ends up making a lot of sense.  The first time you play through the game, there are no choices at all. You simply read the story from the beginning to the end. The first playthrough itself is the longest of all, and is so well put together that the player might feel like they have finished the game completely. All the elements are there – characters are introduced, the protagonist grows and comes to terms with his own personality and feelings, the evil is defeated, love is found. After the credits you are simply returned to the main menu and the book is closed. But if you paid any attention, you noticed that it's not actually the book that has come to an end, but Chapter 1. Plus, there are so many things that have been mentioned throughout the game that you're curious about -what happened to all the other characters? What were their motivations? The Chapter 2 begins upon hitting the “Start” button again and starting a new game. If you still remember what has happened during your first playthrough, you can hit the “Skip” button in the bottom left corner. The story will go along just as it did before – until it doesn't. At one point in the story you encounter something that wasn't there before – a decision. If you decide to take the character's hand in this scene you will continue on to Chapter 2, and if you push them away you will simply read Chapter 1 again. From this point on, the game is very different from before – while there are no more decisions to be made, Tamamori has gone down a different path, and learns more about his friends from a different perspective, finding a different solution to his problem at the end. Once the credits are over, you are greeted by the main menu again. The game is still not over however. Same as before, start a new game, and skip until you get to the decision you made to unlock Chapter 2. This time ignore this option, and don't take the hand offered to you, playing along the lines of Chapter 1 (meaning you can once again hit the Skip button). And voila – not long after, another character offers Tamamori their hand. See the pattern? Taking the hand will lead you down Chapter 3, while pushing them away simply continues Chapter 1. The same formula repeats for Chapter 4  and 5 – each time ignore all the people whose chapter you have already seen, and you will unlock a new option down the road. The fifth chapter is the last one, so upon finishing it, you have seen all that the game has to offer. Although at this point you probably don't even know who you are or what is real anymore, so that's not really a problem. The story is incredibly entertaining, or at least I found it to be so. It's a beautiful mix of murder mystery, fantasy, horror, and anime-like comedy. This mix creates a very dreamy experience, but it does deal with some dark themes; do take the warnings at the beginning of the game seriously so that it doesn't become a nightmare. There were a few things that I didn't enjoy about the story, but the final chapter and its revelations make it a lot easier to forgive and forget those. Some of these issues are explained in the end, and a lot of it is nothing but personal preference, but I will still mention one piece of the puzzle that just didn't fit in for me:  The sex scenes. After being engrossed in the story for about ten hours, the first sex scene sort of comes out of nowhere. I personally felt like all the endings could definitely do without that. It never felt important or like it was really a part of the same story, and it went on for longer than necessary. Plus, I found these scenes to be kind of boring, so I skipped through all of them, and then just quickly ran through the Backlog to see if there was any important information I might have missed that way (most of the time there really wasn't anything at all). The worst thing is that upon finishing the game completely it kind-of sort-of makes sense why the sex scenes were there, but I still believe they could have been handled in a much better way. Also, be warned – some of the characters will be absolute scumbags. Tamamori will somehow overlook this, probably because he believes he's a scumbag himself, but be ready to deal with some insane individuals. The fact I hate one of them so passionately is not such a bad thing though, as it provides some variety. On a different note - it was very interesting to see how homosexuality could have affected some people in that time. While certainly not a perfectly accurate depiction, I appreciated how bigger characters dealt with this problem in their own way; what moved me the most however was seeing how it affected the minor characters' lives. I do not want to spoil anything, but sometimes the little things have a much bigger impact than what's right in front of you the whole time. There is also a character that is implied to be transgender, and although they never outright confirm or deny it, the context is very interesting and provides something to think about. Sinking deeper into the story wouldn't be a good idea at this point, as it's difficult to talk about without spoilers. That's why I'll just mention a few things other than the story that make this game what it is. The art is incredibly beautiful. Many of the scenes have their own CG rather than relying on character sprites, and they guide the reader through this fantastical world really well. The artist's use of colour is breathtaking, and I haven't encountered any art in this game that felt unpolished. All the characters and backgrounds are very detailed and consistent, and fit with the story and each other perfectly. The soundtrack is just as pleasant. While I wouldn't mind if there were a few more songs, the music is not annoying even after hearing it for a while, and it truly brings out the emotions of all the scenes. If you ever want to relive what you've felt while playing this game, all you need to do is listen to the soundtrack and close your eyes to see all those vivid colours again. And last but not least – Pop-Up Encyclopedia. As the story takes place in 1922 Japan, there are many terms and places that not all readers will be familiar with. This function highlights such terms, so that you can easily click on them and the game will explain what the word means or tell you a bit more about the history behind it. It's a very useful tool, and one I recommend turning on in the settings. All in all, this game is not a disappointment. If you enjoy dark visual novels and don't mind seeing two men being ridiculously awkward with each other, it's definitely something to add to your library.",1,0,en

"Creative and immersive, that's how I'd describe  . This game is a journey through anxiety and depression of a high school student, Stiles.  From a gameplay perspective it's a Walking Simulator/Psychological Horror. What Remains of Edith Finch is probably the closest similar game that I remember, but What Happened is definitely a unique project. Pros: + A lot of creative decisions for visuals/atmosphere/gameplay. Intuitive level design. + Great visuals/sounds and technical part as a whole. Good voice acting. + A solid lenght (5+ hours) for a game of this genre, with a great variety of events/locations. And a few words about the story before mentioning things that I didn't like. This story is about anxiety and depression, bullying in school and personal tragedies, friendship and betrayal, your own demons and suicide. While all these topics are rather serious and were depicted quite well in the game, personally, I did not get enough details of the story to dive into it more fully and to understand the characters (and game ending didn't help me at all). Cons: - I didn't like all the characters. I wasn't able to empathize MC while I totally understand the game's message. From the store page - ""The empathy you show for the character will subtly affect the outcome of his journey."" Yeah, I got a bad ending, heh. - A common issue for any walking simulator - replayability. I've missed some achievements and there's 2 other endings, but replaying the whole game while being unable to even skip cutscenes would be too much for me, at least for now. I actually started a new game after completing my first run and I had some hopes that it's possible to at least get a different ending faster somehow. But it seems like there's no way. All in all,   will be interesting for people who like walking simulators and psychological horrors. I enjoyed it mostly because of an impressive technical part and creative game design decisions, while the story itself wasn't that interesting for me. 8/10 P.S. I don't think that it was an actual reference but a couple of scenes heavily reminded me of a ""house"" from Lars von Trier's ""The House That Jack Built"".",1,0,en

"No, honestly, it has great parkour moves! This game is what started my obsession with the computer and the video game industry. One of my first games, it did not fail to make me interested in it.  I have finished this game twice since I first played it in 2010, but sadly I was a pirate. Tbh, I feel it's kinda pricey being at 20$[MUST BUY IN SALE] but it's worth the cash! It might look outdated but for its time, it's pretty awesome!  Story is all over the place, whereas the gameplay is frigging fantastic.  In its prime, the game proved that   Maybe even better? You have amazing abilities! I love the little stealth options they put in the game. Or you could just f**k ♥♥♥♥ up and boy, do I mean F**K THINGS UP.  There's a great fix for the resolution cap of this game, in the guides which I used.

Oh, also his jacket IS available on Amazon ;D 10/10 {P.S- use Ctrl button to make Alex walk, do that in a crowd and watch him push/slap people off like they're trash, lol at hearing them whining like a bi*ch, I pushed a police officer and became most wanted in 2 minutes OR consume a high ranked official, in disguise bully your noob juniors repeatedly while walking casually and pushing them off}",1,0,en

"INSIDE is a work of art that simply manages to say so much without having to say anything. Its own way of articulating itself will pull you into the center of one of the most creative, most magnificent and most hauntingly interesting experiences ever made in videogames history. INSIDE cleverly tells a captivating story through a twisted universe brimming with artistic touches depicted on every nook and cranny. It’s an immersive experience that is packed with ineffable feelings, intense moments, challenging puzzles, brilliant mechanics, stunning visuals and sound design.  The story behind INSIDE doesn't unfold itself clearly right before your eyes -- but rather it lives up to its own name and goes ""inside"" your brain; its unspoken mind-bending narrative leaves a door open to imaginative interpretations in order to make sense out of it. Pros:  + Intelligent storytelling + Perfectly designed, smooth, fun and creative gameplay  + Well crafted set of challenging puzzles  + Atmospheric, artistic and immersive world  + Immaculate execution and presentation  + Hidden areas and collectibles Cons:  - A bit short - Small replay value 9.5/10 – INSIDE is one hell of an unforgettable experience and a standout in every single way.",1,0,en

"I really enjoy multiple solitaire games made by The Revills Games group. I have played through multiple times their Chef Solitaire: USA and their Santa's Christmas Solitaire 1 & 2 (which I get out to go through every Christmas season for some mindless fun)! This game has solitaire twists like power ups and mini games and you can choose your game play out of 3 available play modes.  What stands out to me in their games is the great artwork and soundtrack that accompanies their games narratives. I really wish they would include a art gallery of their art or a wallpaper gallery as a bonus in game for those of us who appreciate the artwork and want to enjoy it on our monitors. Really big shout out to the artists!  All of their games have run smooth for me on ultra wide monitor with no crashes or bugs found.

"Has-Been Heroes delivers on it's promise of being ""a challenging, lane-based roguelike game of strategy and action."" It's a very well balanced and well polished game, that leaves me with the ""one more turn"" feeling after every run I complete, whether it was successful or not. The randomly generated levels will often provide options for your party of heroes. Whether to rush towards the boss level along the most efficient route or to explore as fully as possible gaining additional gold from battles and items & spells from vendors or shops. The items and spells are also random. This can cause the occasional run where things just don't go well. The routes are bad, and the items offered are weak. However, runs are quite short (especially if you are a little on the weaker side) and overall progression is still made by collecting souls. The overall progression system is one where each battle provides you with souls and upon defeat or completion these souls are accumulated to fill soul orbs which unlock new items for the game. So in future runs you'll see a few new things sprinkled in with the old and familiar. You also unlock new heroes by completing the game.  The progression works well and even one new item can make enough of an impact if it's the right one. It can feel a little slow though, especially when it comes to unlocking heroes. The first couple of runs are really fast, but with each new run a zone is added. So the first game just requires completing two zones, the next three, then four and so on. The longer that runs go, the more items you have access too and the more powerful your team is as a result. The downside of longer runs is that is provides more opportunities for bad luck to strike. All it takes is one poor battle to end a run. In that respect the game can be quite unforgiving. In the tougher battles one small mistake can end a run.  In the battles the combat is rather neat. It's lane based, but you can (and should) move your heroes throughout the battle. Melee attacks have a cooldown as do the spells. Once they're available they can be stored until the time is right to use them. Combat is able to be paused at any time too. So you can stop and plan out your next few moves whenever you like. You'll be able to have the heroes switch lanes whenever they melee attack an enemy, with the hero who charged forward assaulting each enemy it hits on the way back. This can cause some interesting decisions like choosing to hit an enemy of a lesser threat in one lane because it's further back and the hero can land attacks on multiple monsters in another lane when they return to their position.  HBH is not perfect. It can definitely feel frustrating when things aren't going well, and the game can feel unfair when there are twenty skeletons heading towards your party and everything is on cooldown. The small nuisances are not enough to detract from what is a very good game and a rather fresh experience. Each run feels different and the heroes (whilst falling into three basic categories) have their uniqueness. The modern rogue-like elements are well used. Each run stands on it's own, supported by progression previously made. There's nothing quite like this out there, and there's a very enjoyable experience to be had here. If you're into the modern rogue-like elements, and enjoy lane based combat then this game utilises them well. I have found it very enjoyable and personally it's one of my favourite games of this year. I definitely recommend picking it up. It's really polished and enjoyable. Once you get used to how the combat system works, and learn to attack the monsters stamina appropriately everything sees easier. It's deceptively deep, but also not too complicated. The combat and interactions with spells and elemental effects are really well done and do not fail to keep things interesting.",1,0,en

"If all the good parts from Mario Kart, Sonic All-Star Racing, Hello Kitty Kruisers and of course, the classic Garfield Kart would be made into a smoothie, you'd get this fruity racing game: 100% FRESH! Of course, the main comparison would have been Sugar Rush Speedway from Wreck it Ralph, but a healthier alternative. One of the most fascinating and innovative parts that I have found in this game is the ability to decide, in a certain measure what your power-up will be. In certain races modes you are allowed to collect the 4 seasonal fruits (or more) which will fill up your 4 bars, you are also allowed how to mix and match your fruits based on what is full and what isn't, making combinations of 2,3 and even all 4 (these ultimates are driver specific) which result into some fascinating and thrilling power-ups. Rather than relying on chance, you'd use what's more handy or most fitting at the moment, or you could decide to wait up and collect some more fruit juice for your counters in order to get a different power-up, for a different opportunity. Either way, you'd need to be quite strategic as well a fast thinker during the rush of the race, therefore you'd want to be as efficient as possible in order to choose the best course of action in different situations to obtain optimum results. The art style is cute, the difficulty is manageable and the fun is juicy, especially if you have friends over and a few controllers, the local multiplayer / split screen can be a real delight.

1996 I had a nightmarish childhood with this game and its horror soundtracks :],1,0,en
Infuriating in the most delightful way Life Is Strange​ is possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played. Never before have I found the decisions you make in a game have such massive consequences (not like the end of Mass Effect...) There is usually no obvious option which is a real skill for a game to pull off. I find myself getting very emotionally invested in the story and the characters which for me is a such sign of a good game! The graphics are not mind-blowing but the graphic style really suits the concept of the game. The game balances the moments of real hard decision making with the beautiful moments of serenity and introspective thought. The soundtrack is simply divine and truly captures the potency of the important moments as well as providing the most natural of backdrops for the game in general. The dialogue does sometimes feel just a little unnatural but certain not so as to ruin the game. When I first saw the game on Steam back in February I was instantly intrigued. It took me until May to play it as I had a feeling I would be drawn in to the game too much for my own good. I was right.,1,0,en

"Really good monster taming RPG. The turn bases combat is very well made and I enjoy it pretty much. I am still at the beginning of the game, so I can´t say much about the story (I will probably update this, when I have played enough), but already saw some cool monsters and had some good fights. The graphics and the sound of the game are also both very good, so nothing to complain there :) Would love to have some dlc´s or patches coming, because it´s a really good game. There are only some small things I would like to see which aren´t already included in the game right now , like mounts (or another way to move around faster), steam trading cards and rotation of the camera, but they were all allready named in the community hub, let´s see if they will make it in the game :) Conclusion: I would give it a really good rating, because the game is good and the critiques I have on this game are really small. So I recommend this game to anyone who likes monster taming games or just wants a decent turn based strategy game.",1,0,en

"MK is always the best fighting and the most balanced one. of course with such a good story and lovely characters..that makes it special. mkx has the best graphic as a fighting game and compared to the previous one, it's such a big progress... but the story of mkx was not as good as mk9 but it can be continued and make the best story in mk11 according to its ending. i think this time, they focused on gameplay, graphic, and fight balance many old characters we love are in mkx but some famous characters are not in and some other are not playable but i believe they'll return soon for mk11 and i can't wait to play it. to summarize, whoever likes fighting series will recommend this franchise.",1,0,en

"POE is a somewhat complex game when you head into it w/o any experience, for example people who did not play the Diablo series and are jumping to this game will get challenged mentally. Not to say you cannot learn the community it amazing you can type in chat for help and you have 100+ people insantly wanting to help you and show you how you can get through even people giving you items to start off with. But this definitly is a game you have to do you research on instead of just playing because of the vast selection of builds/skils you have going into the skill tree randomly you will pay for that greatly the higher you go. The PVP is not a major in this game but no one really plays POE for the PVP; because the PVE itself storyline/acts are so fun to do and you unlock so many challenges and rewards as you go higher plus theres many things you can do in the game for example if you finihs a character you can move along to another character build and it will change the whole game comepletely I definitly recommend this game for everyone to try as you dont need to play with friends in order for you to play. To be honest I'd rather be alone when I play this game because of the challenges they place all throughout the game and I need to think about what path I'm going to take in order to do this this and this.",1,0,en

"Really really amazing game. I honestly did not had much expectation from a game this old in 2018, but i think playing this was one of the best game experience. The story was very very interesting, this game had many of my favourite gotham villians, I enjoyed it a lot. It has The Joker, Two Face, Poison Ivy, Dr. Hugo Strange, Solomon Grundy, Ra's Al Ghul, to name a few. Combat was fun, but i think catwoman was a bit weak, had much difficult time with her because she did not have much upgrades. I have finished the joker part but it feels like i put more than just 15 hours in the game, feels like i have been playing it for a long time. The Ra's Al Ghul story part was great. The graphics are not bad but you will forget about it because of how fun it is. The open world is not that bad either, and the collecting the riddller trophies are fun too. Side quests are also great, but i have not got that much into it, rushed throught the story line. They do look interesting, but i was more concerned about finishing the story. I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone",1,0,en

"Two words: Nature Rules. Five years later, I finally managed to check out Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Very unusual slasher, it's neither Devil May Cry nor God of War, it provides a whole new experience. The level design in this game may look the same as MGS4, despite having different engines. Locations can look monotonous, and most of 'em are closed areas/tunnels. And yet somebody might find good spots. OST rocks! I liked most of the soundtrack, especially boss battle themes. Too bad there's no option to buy it on Steam, would love to listen it here.  The plot takes place four years after MGS4. If you haven't played other MGS games then you probably won't spoil anything to yourself, but I'll tell some unusual plot parts in spoiler section.  MGR:R's story may not have plot twists, and sometimes it's ridiculous. MG's lore continues on, but it doesn't reach same level as main MGS games. You have to learn a lot of things through codec dialogues as it was in previous titles. First time they cause interest, although later on they may bring down game's pace which suits well for stealth genre, but not slasher.  The gameplay itself, like I said before, provides new experience. An interesting idea with the ability to cut into pieces almost all objects in the game, whether they're cyborgs, vehicles or interior items. However, it is necessary to delve into it from the tutorials, non-experts might go through hard times dealing with parrying and combos. I must admit I never used combos that much, so I'll try to do it next time I return back to this game. Customization is simple if you compare it to the same DMC, but I think it works well. There are some elements from MGS games like use of sub-weapons such as grenades and rocket launchers and ability to hide in cardboard box and barrel. Plus you can buy new items after you beat the game and armor suits such as legendary Gray Fox's suit. I was pleased with both the main campaign, DLCs and VR missions. The former has cool boss fights with nice implementation, but the second half of the game starting from File R-05 level looks short and fleeting.   DLCs add good parts for story related characters Jetstream Sam and Blade Wolf with new gameplay mechanics. I liked Blade Wolf's story more. And VR missions are hard and challenging just like those VR missions from MGS2.  Now some words about optimization of PC port. Game plays fine, although my FPS counter always showed 59 instead of 60. And its count decreased when I was slicing things in Blade Mode for a long time. Anyway, performance was satisfactory, as I played using gamepad, but didn’t try mouse + keyboard combination. Maybe next time.  I encountered only two bugs though entire game. The first was right after I beat main story and chose Level selection. I don’t know why, but all background pictures for each level looked way too stretched. I couldn’t see them fully. And such graphical bug was present on Combo list and VR missions screen. The second one occurred when I was playing last stages from Blade Wolf DLC (same stages that Raiden visits at the beginning of File R-01). All QTE screens had mouse & keyboard buttons instead of gamepad buttons. But I was able to use gamepad while playing til the end, there wasn’t any device disconnection mistake. I only quitted game and opened it again, and the bugs were gone. It's a pity the original concept of the game as Metal Gear Solid: Rising hasn't been implemented, and we won't see MGR:R2 for known reasons. But the final product isn't so bad. MGS fans may not like it for its weak storytelling, and gamers who have less experience in slasher genre might find it difficult as well. But if you want to play something different than DMC and God of War, then you definitely have to try this one! For me it was nice to play something similar in slasher genre, yet different. I'm glad to have such game in my collection.",1,0,en

"If you think this is a regular top-down MMORPG, then you are wrong! The first thing that catches your eye is the cute and delicate colors of this virtual World and these cute Knights =), but behind this cute appearance there are real heroes who kill bosses and save the whole World! When I first started playing this game, I thought: “Hey, this is for children, but not for me as a gamer who tore the skulls of enemies to pieces with his bare hands”, but after 2-4 hours of playing I realized that I missed this World and these lovely Knights! After all, we all get tired of something ... and we want to plunge into a romantic World, where everything is beautiful and simple, where you are always a Hero! In this World you can rest your heart and soul! The graphics here are peculiar, somewhat similar to anime, but this, nevertheless, is something different! Even after years of this game's existence, it still looks very good! The textures are pleasing to the eye, and it doesn't take a lot of power from your hardware! Music and atmosphere are probably the most important here! After all, it is these melodies of flowers and the spirit that flies in the air around you that make you rest your soul in this World! Sometimes you just want to stand and do nothing, but watch the World around and just enjoy =) The gameplay is also a very important part of this World - after all, you are waiting for travel to the center of the planet and many monsters that will be on our way;) You can also take part in PVP battles in the arena in several modes and just create or join your Guild to conquer the World together with friends! Algorithm! As a person with a mathematical mindset, it was incredibly interesting for me to see an algorithm that randomly creates maps for your travels in this World, so that every trip inside the planet will not be exactly like the other! In fact, 99% of the games that developers create have static maps and worlds, they immediately offer us a mixture of static and dynamic locations, and maps for adventure are constantly generated! This is really amazing! If you understand what prime numbers are and know a little more than Riemann, then you can change Humanity! Of course, the developers did not give us proof of the Riemann hypothesis, but they showed how dry numbers can be the whole World around you! The plot is probably the worst part about this game = (it is not very interesting or eventful, and you may not go through it at all =) Also, the game is tailored for playing with friends, so sometimes it's boring alone = ( These are probably 2 minuses in this game, but they pale before the beauty of this World! If you are a Romantic just like me =), then you should definitely play this game! And it's best to do it with your girlfriend or friends! 9/10 Knights - Honor for your Guild!",1,0,en

"Slashing in first person has never been this satisfying. The story is meh nothing special, Gameplay could be better by adding some mechanics like additional button to run faster for some classes or sliding and such. Definitely needs more maps and enemies and special bosses as it gets repetitive quite easily. The Grinding is not bad but not great either. Quests are very simple; Go from A to B, clear hordes, continue. Quests should be more exciting like Payday 2 or Left 4 Dead 2. Although some of the quests were actually better than the others like collecting bombs and barrels. Some characters' faces are really ugly I hope they fix them soon and the body should be visible when you look down for better immersion because it looks like you are invisible except your hands of course. Overall I recommend this game if you love FPS SLASHER.",1,0,en

"With almost 2000hrs i couldn't say much, the game itself is free and you saw most of the reviews are positive. What do you do, you surely gonna download it and you're excited for the first match of you life after your last play on CS1.6 against bots(which is more entertainment in my opinion) when you are still a kid. Then you joined your first casual lobby, figured out how to buy your first gun and followed the team. Just when you walking outside from your base a guy came out from nowhere looking at the ground spinning with his SCAR-20 and edshots every single people on your team with his   cheats spamming ""nice try kiddo"" in the chat section making you feeling you gonna rage quit in the meantime you will think how can he do that since it's your first time seeing someone that overwhelming. After the match ended, you calm yourself down and thinking the next match will be a clean match but you're wrong, you both moved to the same map after all and the dude thats spinning did the same thing to all your teammates including you and you decided to just alt+f4 and deleted the game. So if you really want to enjoy the clean side of the game, you should get the prime status or go to   for competitive matches. Otherwise you will not get a clean match if you're queuing on the non-prime matches. To the one that just started playing the game, wish you a good luck and avoid all the cheaters at all cost and never ever cheat on this game.",1,0,en

"Game is so sick ! I love it that i play with nobody! I paid like 20x what it costs now and I literally want to commit refund after having it for like 2000 years.  Anyways First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Furthermore if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. After this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.",1,0,en

"Offroad 3DX is a physics based point to point racer, not dissimilar to the Trials series, albeit with some interesting and innovative twists. First off, although very accessible, O3DX is hard..... Very hard, you won't be flying through the levels like in other physics racers. After the first few tutorial levels are finished, you'll have to work hard, just to get to the finish line on most maps.  The first thing that stands out in O3DX is the fact that although you can only move your vehicle on a 2D plain, all the levels are rendered in 3D. This gave the developer, the ability to add things like tricky, slow corners and dynamic camera views.  Mastering the levels requires a mix of leaning forward and backwards as well as clever management of the brakes and acceleration, as you progress through the levels, the game also throws some quite tricky puzzle elements at you, these portions of the game can't be solved with horsepower, only brainpower.   If I would have any criticism about the gameplay at this point, it would be that each level forces you to use a particular vehicle, whether it's a big heavy 4x4 or smaller ATV style vehicles. Some customization options would go a long way, not just on what vehicle you can use, but also livery's and other options to alter the appearance of each of the vehicles. At this point in time, they come how they come, like it or not.  That being said, each one feels distinctly different and are very fun to drive. For the most part the graphics are amazing, the actual levels themselves are beautifully crafted, with great textures and animations throughout, light shafts illuminate the environments and sometimes you can't help but give the environments more attention than the task at hand. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the majority of the vehicles, while some look OK, others look a little low-res and somewhat stand out (I'm looking at you Jeep.) That being said, the game is still in Early Access and I'm sure that at some point,  the developers will give the vehicles the same love they have given to the beautiful environments. Controls are fully redefinable through the launcher, which is always a nice feature. The default keyboard controls are simple but very intuitive, responsiveness is nice too, I've crashed and blown up many vehicles during my time with O3DX, but at no point did I feel the controls were to blame for my demise. At the point of writing this review, I have been unable to use my Xbox 360 controller, this seems to be a known bug that has been acknowledged by the developers, according to a forum post, a patch to fix this issue will be published in the very near future. O3DX is a very well realized point to point physics racer, it offers some new and interesting innovations to the standard formula and they have executed these innovations very well, Easy to get into, but very hard to master, perfectionists will spend hours mastering each of the games levels and even if that's not your thing, O3DX will still consume plenty of your time, The graphics although a little substandard at times, will completely wow you for the majority. If you're a fan of games like Trials or Joe Danger, O3DX is right up your street. I'd have no hesitation in recommending O3DX even at this early point of development. It's not quite there yet, but even now, it's more polished than other games that have already reached the end of their development.  At this moment in time, I'd give O3DX a 7.5 / 10.",1,1,en

"I would reccomend Shadowverse, mostly for the Art and Voice acting because it's honestly really good. Overall the game is solid and fun so yeah, I would reccomend. I do however have some personal gripes with the game aswell, classes seemingly being poorly balanced, one sided matchups and a strange approach on a pay-to-win scheme. Inbalance typically comes from one sided matchups such as Havencraft vs Swordcraft, of which Swordcraft completely destroys Havencraft due to Haven's playstyle revolving around delayed timed cards. Swordcraft plays out as a Zoo-type class who floods the board and goes face, making Havencraft a free win etc.  The pay-to-win aspect I wouldn't be as concerned as usual with because all things considered, if a game is pay-to-win this is the best way for it. Basically all the high-rarity cards are overpowered. An example being a 8 mana 6/7 that summons an amulet on death that gives all your other minions +3/+3. Basically a win condition. Or a legendary amulet that turns all your 3 mana or less cards into 4/3s that can attack straight away.  There seems to be a general lack of board-clear cards too, the ones that are there often require a tedious checklist of circumstances in order to activate rather than just a high mana sweeper.  Though I have complaints I'd still reccomend the game, it is genuinely a lot of fun and will keep you happy if you are a card game lover. The art and voice acting is real nice and for a majority of the time I've played I've had a lot of fun!  8/10",1,0,en

The atmosphere the environments create is def good. As a longtime UO Player i can say it at least catches the UO feeling quite a bit and i like the skill system. Haven't played so much yet and i'm still feeling a bit confused. But there is quite a lot of content / skills / quests whatsoever to keep you entertained for a while. Can't speak for endgame yet.

"Wow, just... wow. I am so impressed by this game that I needed time to think on how to give a proper review for it. This is by far one of the deepest stories I have read and at this point I can only wish it was longer.  We have five characters who are wonderfully unique and each have their own story and issues to overcome. The way this story is presented is absolutely fantastic and is wonderfully artistic throughout the entire read.  I did feel a little iffy about this game in the beginning - but a while after the first puzzle was completed, I begun to realise what a masterpiece this game really was.  The art is very beautiful and unique and the music is beautiful, too. I would be lying if I said I didn't hop onto YouTube straight after playing this game to find the OST collection! This game definitely deserves WAY more attention, especially from visual novel fans.  It has many choices, interesting puzzles and overall a fantastic story.  Please keep in mind that this VN does deal with sensitive topics. Pros:  - Fantastic story - Beautiful music - Great art - Dialogue choices - Fun and interesting puzzles - Likeable characters Cons: - I do personally wish it was longer!! Overall, I give this amazing VN a 10/10, I loved it so much and hope to see similar games in the future!",1,0,en
"basically a coop action rpg with some tower/base defending elements. settled in a colorful natural world, filled with collectibel resources for the craftingsystem and many differend types of enemie's. what i realy like is the way how the dev's work with the community and the pricing model. if the host brought the ascendant expension, everyonr on the server have access to the whole content. for this price, seems more then fair to me. its also a nice way to avoid micortransactions and make's the game more or less free for everyone. so why no higher rating? if you be the host of your server, the game is a performance monster. it went, from time to time, a bit laggy. this happenrd mostly if you play with 3 other players, on your server, and everyone is split over the whole worldmap.",1,0,en

"It's a great game! But you can only appreciate it well if you played all of the previous Dishonored games and DLCs. I loved the gameplay aspect of DotO and how you don't need to care about mana potions. But I really miss the bend time ability. It was the main source of fun in Dishonored 2 for me. The start of the game was quite overwhelming on text content. Lots of notes, books and even too much narration to fill the gaps in the story and try to tell something there. Put this along with the fact that you need knowledge from previous games to be immersed, and that becomes a problem for a standalone game. It's still a good game to be played, in fact I end up prefering DotO instead of Dishonored 2 on gameplay, because of the fresh take on the abilities and story. It's also very pleasing to speedrun. I really recommend playing if you're a Dishonored fan.",1,0,en

"[BEYOND review] See the bottom of my review for the feature that I was most looking forward to from the very beginning :D After playing NMS in VR for an hour, I'm at a loss for words. NMS was already a great game after the NEXT update, and this update brings a level of polish and VR that is mind blowing. Getting in my ship that I've spent countless hours with already and grabbing the controls and leaving orbit was something I will not soon forget. I have not even experienced the other 90% of the update yet but the VR alone is amazing.  We really need proper support for INDEX controllers though. [NEXT review] I've only played the next update for about an hour, but hopped into a game with 3 randos and instantly knew how much more fun it already was. Build a base anywhere, collaborative resource finding, can follow other players anywhere. Also the resource updates are super awesome, much better and way less arbitrary. I already highly recommended NMS, but now it's a must buy if you like exploration/multiplayer/adventure. More to come.. (Add VR NEXT plz.)  Excellent game. I appreciate this game as being a major leap towards an intelligent, universe size alternate reality.  (Add VR to this game.) The updates have been really solid. Keep improving it, the community will come back.  (Add VR to this game.) Needs real player to player interaction. (With VR support.) A++",1,0,en

"I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is. Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing. In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a ""trapped freedom"", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly. With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully. I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly. This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind.",1,0,en
"This game is a blast! Variant gameplay, never gets boring, rich action sequences toe-to-toe with calm and moody interactions of your team. The portrayed alternate history of a Nazi ruled world is terrific and let you think about the true horror aspects of war and inhumanity. It's not a dump shooter but a real gem doing justice to the Wolfenstein series. The game starts by letting you pick between two timelines influencing the rest of the campaign. You can play guns blazing or really stealthy unlocking perks fitting even more to your style. The story unfolds quite unpredictible, including love, sex and a bitter ending. Your fight for freedom is scored by a marvelous soundtrack composed by Mick Gordon, who has also done a stunning job with the DOOM (2016) OST. Seriously, get this awesome game!",1,0,en
"So light car so BEST solution for staying in the air almost forever plus that it gives ya good enough control in there unlike other light cars like hotshot. best car for aerials to me.  On the ground, it drives as flexibly as a monster truck but not as easily as a Hotshot. and hey it has the highest horizontal surface comparing to other cars. But...against heavier cars like Octane (honestly almost all cars are heavier than this lol) when it comes to muscle power it is  like dust ;D so u might find yourself spinning around in the air most of the time as a result of being hit by other cars. also....while having the highest horizontal surface, it has lowest height comparing to other cars (almost 0). so u might find ball crossing over u in a very low height when u dont really expect. as a result of cons, and as i play better on the ground, im still using hotshot like the old days. with the smallest wheels which add less weight to it so i can be as speedy as i can.",1,0,en

"Let's explain the game -Dying Light Dying Light is one of those games that does many things right, and it is a whole lot of fun. Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the companies. The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The side quests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring. The parkour is fluid and connected while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating. It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades. You start off as a novice free runner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with fewer stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat. Fun times. You can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos. For example, you can use ""vault"" on a zombie, followed by a ""drop attack"" for a satisfying combo finisher. If you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the companies. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying. The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date. And while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story. I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches. A missed opportunity, indeed. It is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games properly, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different and more than enough to stand on its own. If you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments. The visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick, and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world, combined with satisfying melee combat complemented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly. The sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music), There are many different zombie types--common, stronger, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I. During the nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol. Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted. An eye icon appears over the actual zombie on the screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart. Day-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers. ""Free-runner"" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected. They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery. The physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments. I highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like ""throwing weapons"" or ""trap bombs."" In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with. Achievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode. Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. The point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment. Nighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kick in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure. However, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like ""forever"" with Volatiles chasing you across the city. There are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include ""challenges"" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specific amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenging scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner. Dying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other. After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included. It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games. Anyway, the story it's pretty cool in my opinion (it's a zombie game what you expect!).After playing through the story I asked myself how much these developers must love Far Cry 3. - Highly recommended. - Huge improvement over Dead Island - Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design - The extremely satisfying melee combat system - Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive - Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades - Great visuals for an open-world game - Immersive and atmospheric - Cool characters - Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue - Great premise - Many zombie types provide for dynamic gameplay - Excellent zombie A.I. - Innovative nighttime zombie gameplay - Excellent and responsive controls - Missed opportunities in plot twist - Ending was anti-climatic - Missed opportunities in potentially good scares - The main protagonist feels hollow - Most characters are unforgettable Personal Rating - 9.0 out of 10.",1,0,en

"Another great mobile game made for pc and it's still as good as it is on mobile. The game still definitely needs more work, there may be some bugs and glitches here and there, but it's still a good game to play while being in quarantine. Have fun everyone! EDIT: Now most of the negative reviews say that the game is pay2win, it's not though. You get pearls from just playing too. Like what. Some people just don't understand properly the p2w aspect. P2w means that you can't do some things, only if you pay a lot of money, and there are like pay walls that a f2p player can't go over, but in KOC, they are only like crab packs and skins, but it's not p2w, because the ""more rarer"" crabs can also lose, you need to know each crabs ultimate abilities to play them properly. Also p2w is also like in some RPGs, where the like armor or weapons are paid, because they are like overpowered and this is stupidly unfair if you play in PVP a lot in those games, then those who have these paid things, they are just unfair to fight against. Again KOC is not p2w, maybe look up what p2w actually means before mentioning in the review.",1,1,en

"If My Heart Had Wings : Summary: After losing his dream to a bicycle racing accident, Aoi Minase returns to his hometown. With no hope left of where to go from hereon out, Aoi meets Kotori Habane, a young girl stuck in a wheel chair with a flat tire. On that hill of windmills begins Aoi's story of youth, friendship and flying.  Upon witnessing a glider drift above, Aoi sets forward on a journey to realise the dream everyone has as a child.  Working together with Aoi’s childhood friend Ageha Himegi, the main characters of this visual novel begin rebuilding the Soaring Club, which was just about to be disbanded. These beginners take hold of their passion, overcoming failures and obstacles from the school to put their all into building a glider.  Their ultimate goal to fly through the ""morning glory"", a special weather phenomenon that enables a special type of roll-shaped cloud that appears in the morning when the conditions are just right.  Join Aoi on this journey as he learns about the sky, his female friends and more. My opinion : I have a lot to tell time visual novel I liked. Start with the history that is for me very well work with a small senario roughly intéraisent that may SEVERAL characters in scene (well built). Then the game is really beautiful to me graphically nothing wrong with a lot of decorations such as : School Airstrip the wind park Then the music I find it nice and goes well with the story we can just blame the lack of music in the crucial scene it remains a detail :) Quite a decision for each character that adds a significant life to the game . (You can also add the uncensored version of PS: I did not test but it adds the scenes ^^ ) Finally there is also the way of some character like Amane I appreciateany much character for that matter or Kotori. Aoi Minase : is the main protagonist of the visual novel. He was a member of the cycling club at his previous school, but unfortunately, injuries to his legs in an accident forced him to retire and return to his hometown of Kazegaura. He had intended on living in his parents’ home but was made the manager of Keifuu Academy’s girls’ dormitory by his mother, who manages the dormitory. He begins to regain the passion he once had after meeting and getting to know Kotori. Kotori Habane : A slender, beautiful girl with long, black hair who is bound to a wheelchair whom Aoi meets on a hill of windmills. Though she is strong willed and speaks with confidence she is at times a cry baby. Her sole reason for transferring to Keifuu Academy is that the school is completely barrier free. She has no interest in the classes which teach specialty fields. Because of this, she is completely cut off from her those around her. She was on the verge of quitting school, until Aoi convinces her to join the soaring club. Ageha Himegi : A fashionable, cheerful, beautiful young girl who has a playfully flirtatious air about her. As she is good with her hands, she belongs to the Robotics Club but soon joins the Soaring Club. She once had feelings for Aoi but she rejected him when he confessed to her. Now, after five years apart, they meet again. Amane Mochizuki : A tall, gorgeous, and very stylish girl, she is senior to most of the main characters. Although she is very intelligent,at times she acts airheaded and can be quite clumsy. Her only flaw is her great love of food. She is the sole member of Keifuu Academy’s Soaring Club before Aoi and his friends join. She continues to enroll in school even though she has officially graduated in order to complete the glider the club is building for her best friend, Isuka.  Asa Kazato : is a girl with a bright and warm air about her. She is Yoru's twin sister and a first-year at Keifuu Academy. She can be a little clumsy, and a bit of an airhead but even those traits are attractive. Asa, who can get along with anyone, helps others get along with each other as well. She and her sister provide their secret base as a garage for the glider.  Thème : Conclusion : A great visual novel cheap for the contained . I also counsel for his characters and ç'est really good music if you worry about playing time does not frighten you around 44 hours a road after another are still fast Anyway there is also the Amane-Senpai success which alone can make you buy the game .",1,0,en

"Lego Marvel Super Heroes is a Lego-themed action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows, and published by Feral Interactive for OS X. The game features gameplay similar to other Lego titles, such as Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga and Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, alternating between various action-adventure sequences and puzzle-solving scenarios. The handheld version of the game by TT Fusion was released under the title Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Universe in Peril for iOS, Android, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. Characters include Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and Nick Fury. A spin-off to the Lego Marvel series titled Lego Marvel's Avengers was released on 26 January 2016. A sequel, Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2, was announced to be in development on 15 May 2017, is set to release for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on 14 November 2017. It starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative. I finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River. The city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend. Overall, I would give this game a 9/10. Great game, fun levels and a good speed to get trough the whole game and archieve 100%, all deadpool jokes also fit nicely and all extra missions are fun.",1,0,en

"Rocksmith 2014; What started as a dream is now turning into a reality for thousands of people across the globe. You said to yourself as a kid while listening to the radio to your favorite song, or while listening to your favorite cassette/8 track (whatever you grew up with) that you wanted to be just like the people in that band. You wanted to grow up to be a ""rock star."" Well Rocksmith 2014 is the way to go. While it might not make you a rock star it'll certainly show you how to play guitar/bass. Rocksmith 2014 is the fastest/easiest way to learn how to play guitar. Either buy yourself a Real Tone Cable (the 1/4"" jack for your guitar/bass to USB) or with their newest ""Remastered"" update of Rocksmith 2014, use your microphone that's on your computer. Personally I would recommend you spend the extra money for the cable if you don't have that amazing of a microphone. Rocksmith 2014 is LOADED with tons of your favorite artists/bands to choose from and believe me, that list of DLC can look a little intimidating but if you don't wanna spend the money now. just wait for a Steam sale. As of now, the total cost if you were to buy all the DLC at one time is well over $3600 USD (1/2/2017) but there is always more content being released for you to choose from. So what are you waiting for? You've wanted to learn how to play since you were a kid. Get up and do it! There's nothing stopping you now.",1,0,en

"I read it somewhere already and can only confirm: ""Minecraft with guns"", and better looking I would also add.  As a soft core survivalist, I enjoy more the building/mining/crafting/farming aspect of the game and play mostly offline and on easy setting regarding the zombies and I add some challenge through less loot. I find it still challenging enough especially in the endgame region - the big city in the middle of the map. The creation of a new game offers enough options for an offline gamer, so you can make everything between Minecraft and Doom (ok maybe not) out of it.  The developers are serious guys and the game is being constantly updated - getting better in my opinion. Regarding the multiplayer, I can't really say much, since I spent maybe 1 hour on servers.",1,1,en

": This game offer it's own unique charm as 90s internet simulator quite well and it's story is pretty good... if you can get pass some hard cases in the mid-game where clues are very subtle and require some special in-game tools to solve it. Feel free to use guide/hint for this game. [New email recieved from Erastisa] Dear readers Here is my though about ""Hypnospace Outlaw"" At first...I think it's gonna be just a nostalgia-bait with some discovery-based detective game mechanic as a give-away. But it's actually more than that. Still it's part of being nostalgia inducing is well done too. You could consider this as a quirky 90s internet emulator with semi-eerie dream-weaved atmosphere.  All those MIDI quality music, Weird shock sites, Otherworldly superstition webpages, Conspiracy News (This one seem to persist until these days), Annoying viruses, Virtual Pet, Cute Hamster, Fight between music scenes...and ""Hello, this is Professor Helper!"" all these are part of memories from pre-blogging era of websurfers (Oh well... I haven't heard this term for a very long time.) Apart from these nostalgic moment of reliving 90s web. Players are tasked to report contents from these webs that break any of 5 Hypnospace's rules. This seem easy on a first few tasks but later on things get more and more well-hidden and even some hints scatter around the interweb get more and more cryptic. Not to say that things are more twist and get complicated at the near end. Feel free to use guide or hint because   the end... It's one beautifully wrapped story. Yes! this game actually have good story with human touch behind it's mechanical nostalgic interface. Your robotic ban-hammering work is a journey to discover heart and mind of people behind this virtual space... (by ""heart"" I mean...   With Respect, Hypno-Enforcer Erastisa PS. Oh yeah... almost forgot. Music in this game is totally   too.",1,0,en

"""Jason, now you'll never marry,"" now you're an ""assassin."" The developers took into account their past mistakes, and approached the creation of the third part with the understanding that the game should entertain, and not strain. Far Cry 3 turned out to be one of the best games in the open world, but there is no need to build illusions about the vast and diverse world, since the open world is here for entourage and prolongation of stay in the game. Uniform tasks were not canceled. But the game does not make clear the island, carrying out the same type of instructions to open new weapons and skills. Only you decide what to do and what not. The developers tried to have everyone find employment for themselves, starting from banal gathering, ending with a dive on the ""suit-wing"" of enemy outposts. Oh yeah, here, there's also a story, but that's another story.",1,0,en

"The plot is simplistic at first, but gains momentum and complexity as the game progresses. The gameplay is the best example of pure stealth I have seen. Enemies will kill you quickly and efficiently if you allow them, but utlizing your ninja abilities and tools you can overcome them with finesse over brute force. After you beat the game there is a New Game Plus option that limits your perception, but if you don't want to do that there are several suits that provide different play styles (silent running at the cost of no weapon, terrorizing guards but losing your distraction tools) to keep the game fresh for another playthrough (each level is also scored based on your actions, so there's always the option of going for your new high score). Highly reccomend this  even if you're not a pure stealth fan, it's a very high quality game.",1,0,en

What I like is that this game is fairly easy and also getting achievements doesn't require you to do something epic.

The only exception are two achievements that require you to get someone to play and ""challenge"" you - luckily this game is played a lot (unlike from Two Worlds 2 for example) so it took me just a couple hours until someone answered my plea on the forum.",1,0,en

The Following is a fantastically done DLC/follow up which adds vehicular fun and a conclusion to this storyline.  The controls were not complicated.  Quick time elements were minimal but used appropriately.  There are some puzzles but not too complex.  The action felt good.  Weapons had plenty of variety.  Crafting and looting were present.  I bought for around $15 and it impressed me enough to watch for Dying Light 2.  The progression of developing your character grew right along with the story and progression of the game.  While one may feel like a total bada** towards the late middle to end game, there are still plenty of challenges i.e. freaks of nature battles, being swarmed, volatiles, nests, etc.  Combat with hand held weapons or range weapons are only part of the game.  There are challenges outside the story/campaign that will test stealth, driving, parkour etc.  There is a mode to be the zombie.  There is multi player and coop play.  There is still active support for this game like the Halloween 2020 community event.  There are collectibles, including notes that may touch you with thinking about the plausibility of what people would say or how they would react in a zombie crisis.  The music and sound adds to the atmosphere and is used adeptly to create different senses such as hearing when a zombie is approaching while you are trying to pick a lock.  A word of caution for some players; there are several missions that will have you go to high places; if you have fear of heights (like myself), these missions may cause some anxiety.  I can say that there are also some missions in the main campaign that are timed and may have to be repeated based on timing and performance; there are options with choosing the level of difficulty.  There is a sense of accomplishment when finishing several missions like the final showdown with the main antagonist of the campaign.  Kudos to Techland for putting together a game that has a lot in it and manages to be fun.",1,0,en

"I would like to recommend this classic 90s game to all of you, 10/10. If you are a fan, then you should give it a try and experience it. Original FF7 should not be forgotten from my point of view. Although it was released 23 years ago, but still I love it that much. Oh wait, how can I forget FF7 Advent Children? The first time I watch it is more than 10 years ago, until now I still watch it repeatly. It is my favourite movie of all time, the animations are gorgeous and I deeply love the characters (protagonists and antagonists) that much. Cloud, Tifa and Aerith are my top favourite protagonists on FF7. Also, I do enjoy its soundstracks/ musics a lot while playing a game. Yet, I haven't played that much but I will give much attention on it. Lastly, I really can't wait to experience FF7 remake but it is 1-year PS4 exclusive. That's mean SE will release PC version of it by next year, just like WOFF and FFXV.",1,0,en

"With such a title, I pretty much knew what to expect even before I booted up ODIA. An intentional adaptation of the word “hate” in Spanish and Italian (odio), though the Latin “odium” would have suited this game far better. For which classic civilization was (mis)shaped by hubris & hatred more than the ever-expanding Roman Republic and its subsequent Empire? Greed will only take you so far unless you “wrap it up” in a more presentable manner for the uneducated masses. War declarations need a pretext, a “casus belli” which is invoked before the invasion and occupation of foreign territories. Cultural superiority (perceived or realistic) along with the illusion of embarking on a mission to civilize and enlighten, were main driving forces behind most Roman conquests in Antiquity. Once you’ve bit more than you can chew, the downfall is only a matter of time though. The Steam debut for Captain Bear Games who also self-published ODIA, leaves players to form their own impressions while offering an open-ended approach to both the storyline and the gameplay. It’s hard to sympathize with raiding barbarians even as they’re defending their homesteads, yet ODIA has actually reversed roles here as you’re representing the attacking hordes, seemingly endless and without proper leadership. The defenders seem to be a pseudo-medieval society which mixes explosives and firearms with half-plate armor and the occasional sword or halberd. The entire narrative is open to debate as the developer opted for no context at all. Not even a static screen explaining some basic concepts or motivations. We’re roleplaying the “demonic forces” assaulting a heavily defended town, in hopes of capturing its landmark cathedral for some sinister reason. The word “odia” is appearing in-game as graffiti claiming that it’s somehow linked to fascism. Very random if you ask me. The faction you’re apart of, resembles the Tusken Raiders from the Star Wars franchise far more than an organized fascist army (discipline being one of its main ideological tenets). And just like those nomadic Sand People, your only offensive option is represented by a slow-firing rifle that’s both inaccurate and underpowered when compared to the arsenal of the defending forces. Sniper rifles, machine guns and mortars on top of the barbed wire fences and minefields which make the initial advancement extremely difficult and quite deadly. Don’t despair, since one of the key elements to the story is represented by the infinite number of respawns for players and friendly-AI, while the enemy cannot regenerate troops at all. One unsuccessful wave after another shall be obliterated before the defenses are finally penetrated and your hordes can descend upon the helpless civilians, apparently abandoned by the armed forces which should have sheltered them. It paints a grim picture and it also exemplifies the pragmatic concept of “collateral damage” perceived by the executive branch regardless on which side of the fence it’s situated on. Slaughtering innocents during a siege is a war crime by any other definition. Even if you won’t partake in this directly, your dumber-than-a-brick allies will gladly kill any civilians they find. The irony of it all is that this semi-useless friendly AI can’t properly support you in the struggle against the armed defenders, yet they’ll “efficiently” terminate targets which can’t shoot back. Truly the only utility of your “allies” is to draw enemy attention unto themselves. They’re cannon fodder, just as intended by whoever sent them into battle ill-prepared and without clear instructions or oversight. An army without officers is far too similar to a mob of frenzied apes than anything else.  This game is using the Unity Engine to showcase its hybrid projection of both 2D sprites and 3D environments. I applaud the decision to appeal towards old-school fans of first person shooters while also presenting something fresh for players which haven’t experienced this graphical transition as it occurred naturally in the late ‘90s. Getting some strong Daggerfall vibes from ODIA. As far as its performance is concerned, it will run smoothly on almost any system as well as properly scaling to your native resolution. Unity standard fare which couldn’t be criticized anyway. No CTDs or frame rate drops to report. Sounds on the other hand, are few and far between a couple of lousy rifle shots from either side or if you’re standing dangerously close towards an incoming mortar shell. No voice acting while the soundtrack would make even looped elevator music seem a masterpiece by comparison. Mute it and listen to whatever you like instead. I went for a recently-discovered subgenre called “bardcore” which fits ODIA’s portrayed absurdity like a custom-tailored glove. Linked below is my favorite animated metaphor on wartime hatred. Irrationality taken to inhumane extremes… In the absence of a story, the gameplay is forced to compensate. Poorly might I add, since you can interpret far too many elements at the same time. Is the cause just or am I a villain? You’re given no choice in this conflict. Being literally the only intelligent attacker from a horde of hooded barbarians, your faction’s chance of success depends entirely on your shooting and evasion skills. As if the underpowered rifle you’re equipped with wasn’t bad enough, receiving a flimsy shield as a last line of defense only adds insult to the many injuries you’ll sustain. Evading bullets, mines or shells by side-stepping is the main distinction between players and the brain dead AI. No worries if you’ll perish, the respawn is just a couple of seconds away and it’s literally linked to a “mothership” by a long chain which acts as a checkpoint system. Rinse and repeat until you shoot your way to that massive cathedral. Enemy diversity is well represented and will pose a challenge if you impose upon yourself the discipline otherwise lacking in your fellow combatants. Carefully lining up those shots, remaining constantly on the move and using whatever cover you can reach, all represent tactics which offset the technical advantages of your foes. Too bad that you can never pick better weapons or use any sort of power-ups apart from holding the right-click to increase the damage of your obsolete equipment. I feel like the gameplay suffers from stagnation as a result of never advancing your characters abilities. This was intentional too, even if in real warfare it’s perfectly fine to adapt  and counter the enemy’s stategy as well as using captured gear if it proves to be superior.  Still gonna recommend this title to any player looking for a deliberately ambiguous scenario that blurs the thin lines of morality between an attacker and a defender. Without proper context or bare minimum narrative elements, ODIA may not cater to a large enough audience though. Picking it up as a nostalgic trip on “Daggerfall with guns”, may still not suffice. A price cut and some further incentives such as Steam Achievements are critically required. The sooner, the better. + Challenging gameplay. + Interesting concept regardless of its execution. - No Steam Achievements or Trading Cards yet. - Far too ambiguous, offers no context. - Repetitive sounds.",1,0,en
"If you are looking for a true sucessor to the likes of Rainbow Six 3 and the original Ghost Recon games, look no further, Ground Branch is that game.  Whilst the game is still lacking when it comes to content, BlackFoot Studios has really polished the main elements and mechanics of the game, which was where those shooters of old severely faltered: clearing cramped rooms is an achievable and satisfying to pull off task, rather than an awkward and clunky one, as was often the case in the old Tom Clancy titles, mainly due to painfully archaic gunplay. The systems that are already in place already show a level of brilliance that has frankly almost never been seen in a tactical shooter. The freedom to place attachments wherever you want on your rifles and to assemble the tool you think will be most viable to the missions, along with the ability to individually place pouches and equipment on your vest will provide endless entertainment and possibilities to those tactically inclined. All this game needs now is a framework where all its amazing features can be taken advantage of, a proper campaign with plenty of room for player choice, and when that is finally included, Ground Branch will surely be the definitive tactical shooter.",1,1,en
"For a demo, this is really really long. No lie on the Jumbo part. I like the combat, world, setting, crafting, feel of the game in general. My two biggest gripes are. The Camera - it can be a real pain in the arse at times. This can make placing blocks kinda funky. They have a lock on system sure but it's just not quite as refined and easy to do as something like Minecraft was. Cooking - It's just kinda slow and I can't queue up multiple recipes of the same thing in one fireplace. Sure I can make many fireplaces and do it that way, but it just makes it more time consuming for the same result.  Overall, it's good, and I'm sure there's ways to fix the camera. It's just not as intuitive as I would prefer.",1,0,en

"If you've been looking for a fun side scrolling game where you play as a disembodied/decapitated/re-animated head then this is just the game for you! Playing as the mysterious head in question, you find yourself floating around a giant futuristic space station with a very cool 70's vibe. Here, you attach yourself to various robotic bodies to help you navigate your way around the expansive corridors and hallways. There are several distinct maps to explore. There's some light puzzle work to enjoy as well: Lasers bouncing off of mirrors and utilising different robot colours to open differently coloured doors, but nothing too tricky. There's a little bit of back tracking as you progress throughout the game. On the plus side, there's a generous number of upgrades to collect and side quests to complete. Finally, a perfect synth score adds to the unique funky atmosphere as you explore the brightly coloured locations.  Lots of fun and highly recommended!",1,0,en

"""Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive."" Set at a point between Borderlands and Borderlands 2, four aspiring Vault Hunters fight alongside Handsome Jack, witnessing his transformation into the ruthless tyrant people loved to hate in Borderlands 2, and inadvertently assisting with the rise of the Hyperion Corporation and his position within it. My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance: - Atmosphere  - Characters  - Details  - Tactical demand  - Story  - Combat & Controls Based on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: - S-Rank: excellent  - A-Rank: very good  - B-Rank: solid  - C-Rank: satisfactory  - D-Rank: inferior In case of an S-Rank rating, a game reference will be included in brackets as a token of my respect. Atmosphere: S-Rank (You make me so proud, minion. The way you're carrying on my fight against Sentinel and 5H4D0W-TP. It brings a tear to my eye. A figurative one, of course. The saline content of actual tears would rust my eye quicker than you could say 'tetanus shot’.) Characters: S-Rank (When Claptrap speaks, I feel my brain cells committing suicide one by one.) Details: S-Rank (Did I mention I don’t have a medical license?) Tactical demand: S-Rank (If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs!) Story: S-Rank (With the Sentinel defeated, Jack enters the Vault and greets the Vault Hunters, but finds no item of value, other than a mysterious symbol floating midair. As he attempts to interact with it, the symbol then shows Jack a vision of the Warrior awakening. However, the vision is interrupted by Lilith, who phasewalks in front of him and punches through the Vault symbol, burning it onto Jack's face. She then disappears, leaving Jack behind with the Vault Hunters. Jack, having gone insane from the vision as well as Lilith's attack, swears vengeance on her, and all the ""bandits"" on Pandora. Realizing that the hero who once saved her on Helios is no more, Athena leaves Jack's employ.) Combat & Controls: S-Rank (1337 H4XZ00R!) To conquer all achievements of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, you will most likely spend more than 100 hours. You have to play the single-player campaign several times, due to challenges like ‘That Helped, Right?’ and ‘Executioner’. ‘Challenger’ is a typical grind achievement. ‘The Duelist’, ‘Mouth To Mouth’ and ‘Who you gonna call?’ are the only multiplayer achievement and quite simple to obtain. ‘The Bigger They Are’ will take the most time, because it requires a character around level 50 or higher. The achievements of the two DLCs are straight forward and easy enough to get with a high level character. Achievement difficulty: 9 of 10 Common:  - Singleplayer [+2]  - Multiplayer [+1] Special:  - Challenger [+1]  - The Bigger They Are [+1]  - Executioner [+1]  - That Helped, Right?

"Train Valley is a real time puzzle-strategy game based on trains and railroads. The player connects train stations and makes sure trains reach their correct destination by changing switches on the railroad he/she build himself/herself. The game has a nice simplistic menu that is shaped as a stockbook (book that is used by stamp collectors). Every Postage stamp in it is a level of the game. There are 20 levels total. The game has two game modes. One of them is classic mode which consist of levels that has a time and money limit, and also have optional objectives. The other mode is sandbox. As the name suggests, there are no restrictions and limits. Also in this mode, the player decides stations’ spawn time and when a train is scheduled from a station. At the beginning, all levels except the first one is locked. New levels are opened by beating the previous level. To play sandbox version of a level, the player needs to beat the same level in classic mode. First level is a tutorial level that shows basics of the game. Although it shows the most important parts of the game with nice message boxes, other parts are only mentioned in small bubbles that can be easily missed. Luckily, game is very simple and can be learned in a few games. That said, it would be nice to have a better tutorial. A level starts with two stations. Player is given some money to build railroads. After that trains start to be scheduled. When such train is scheduled, an icon appears on the station it is in. Then player starts the train by simply clicking it. That said, it is not possible to make a train wait forever. After an unknown time, it starts to count down from 5 and moves when the countdown reaches zero. As time passes, more stations are spawned making the game and railroad network more complicated. That said, it will never be too complicated as a tycoon but has its challenges of its own. Origin and destination of a train is handled very nicely in the game. It is color coded. Every train and station has a color on it. And the purpose is to make a train reach the station with the same color. When the train reaches its destination, the player gets the money. Amount of money is determined at the time of the spawn of a train. After that it will start decreasing even if the train is still in the starting station.  This game is not a detailed tycoon game. It is designed as a puzzle-strategy game. The main purpose of the game in a level is not to bankrupt, but in this game, “bankrupt” means “negative money”. There are no loans, no maintenance cost, no economy. The player earns money by making a train reach its correct destination. After that he/she uses the money to build railroads to connect newly spawned stations. Every game year, a constant tax is debited from the money. There are only two ways the player’s money goes below zero; tax and train crash. As soon as the player’s money is negative, he/she loses. This mechanic is the games strategy part. The puzzle part is more interesting. Because the actual puzzle is built by the player without him/her realizing. After connecting a few stations with railroads, railroads become a (simple) maze with switches left and right. More stations mean more railroads with more switches. It is never possible to create a network without switches because of either landscape or money constraints. Towards the end of a level, the player keeps clicking switches to send the trains to correct road and prevent crashes. This is the most fun part of the game. Sounds in the game is nice and relaxing but it would be better to have a few different sound tracks. Total game length is a bit short. There are 20 levels but if the player doesn’t care about optional objectives, then they will end quickly.  All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.  Because it is simple and lacks ambition, it is fit to be played just to relax.  Don’t have many levels. Train valley is a nice and relaxing game. It gives the feeling of playing actual toy trains and if you like trains, you probably will like this game. That said, because it is short, I recommend it to be best considered as a side game when you got bored of other stuff.",1,0,en
"Battle for Bikini Bottom was a game that I saw videos and images of, but never actually played myself. When the remaster was announced, I was curious. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, and was somewhat surprised when I found myself really liking it. By the time I finished it, I could safely say that it was one of the best games I've played this year.  + The game retains the same wit and charm that the TV show is well known for, and is a brilliant video game representation of the world of SpongeBob. It's also good to see most of the original voice actors reprise their roles. Shame about no Clancy Brown though. + The levels all feel distinct from one another. Each location is iconic both in its visual design and its level structure. There was never a moment where I felt the levels were lacking. If anything, I'd say the levels are my favourite aspect of this game. + Although not that different from the original, the game is really satisfying to play. Most of the mechanics are smooth, and the combat is quite entertaining. + Each level introduces either a new mechanic or a new enemy. Because of this, the game always feels refreshing.   + The game is rather easy to play, but there are moments that can genuinely be challenging and force you to approach the situation from a different angle, something that I wasn't expecting and was pleased to see. + The updated visuals make the environments and the character models shine. The bright colours give everything more life, and as a whole, make the levels much more memorable. + Being able to play as Patrick and Sandy as well as SpongeBob varies up the gameplay a bit, removing the risk of repetitiveness. They're both also very fun to play as.  + The story itself is quite decent. Yes, it's childish, but it's exactly what you would expect from SpongeBob. It's an amusing, silly and memorable experience.  - A couple of mechanics such as Patrick's throw and SpongeBob’s Cruise Bubble feel a bit off. Patrick's throw is annoying to aim, and the Cruise Bubble can be awkward to control in enclosed environments. - Although a minor problem, sometimes the camera would feel a bit janky. It’s more noticeable when switching characters. Most of the time the camera is fine, but there is the odd instance where it got in the way. Battle for Bikini Bottom took me by surprise. I wasn’t expecting to have so much fun playing a SpongeBob game that was obviously aimed at kids, but regardless, I did. As somebody who used to watch this show as a child, it took me back. The same childish humour is there, and despite a couple of different voice actors, the characters stay true to their cartoon counterparts.  However, it’s the level design, the gorgeous visuals and the (mostly) smooth game mechanics that really make this game shine for me. The game never became repetitive and it never lost its charm. It found ways to keep itself feeling different and interesting. Yes a few of the controls and the mechanics feel a bit off, and that is a shame. I haven’t tried the multiplayer, and according to some reviews, it’s not great. Nevertheless, I don’t think these issues dumb the game down that much.  If you were a fan of the original Battle for Bikini Bottom, a fan of the show, or just want a fun platformer, then I highly recommend this. It’s one of the best games I have played this year. 9.5/10.",1,0,en
"This game is amazing. I always play as Duo or Squads. I really enjoy the gun play. Aiming and shooting is smooth. Finding attachments to improve the weapon is also really good. The overall detail of the guns & building is fantastic.  Audio is perfect. My headset can help me pinpoint where gun shots are coming from.. My only complaint is that, ""Sometimes"" you spend most of your time running for the safe zones.  In some cases it feels the time between zone decreases is to quick. My rating is a 9/10. As there is still some bugs in the game. But it is beautifully made and runs really smooth. I know they have made 'alot' of money from Early Acess purchases. But the game is developed really well and they have been keeping ontop of patches and fixes so far. Most people will compare this to H1Z1 KOTK.. DON'T!. The target of the game is the same, yes. But these are 2 seperate games and both have different pros and cons. I HIGHLY recommend PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds. A really amazing, fun game as it stands. And really great potential to grow into something bigger!",1,1,en

"This is probably the most interesting DLC so far, and it's nothing like the previous ones. The price might look high with its ~20€, but what this DLC adds is amazing me. It focuses on empires and the papacy, also revolutions and such from what I understand. The missions trees are reworked and fleshed out, hasn't checked all nations in Europe but it's not the boring, generic trees.  HRE is more than a powerful alliance. I'm playing as Austria and Austria is fun to play in general, but this DLC makes it way better Imo. In less than 20 years, I've made Bohemia and Hungary enter a union with me, I've had 2 imperial ban wars against Flanders and Venice, and I'm building up for a war against Burgundy. But that has nothing to do with HRE, or? It kinda does. HRE has something called Incidents now, and here you can either get the princes approval or not for different questions. In this case, I had the shadow kingdom and decided to focus on having Italy to stay. The feature feels like an advisor, running through the corridors of your palace and alarming you about what might happem if we have our focus elsewhere. Estates are reworked too. They're less micromanagement and more macromanagement. It feels more balanced than before and made me, someone who didn't like the estates, actually love to play with them.  Costal defences. Basically costal artillery to slow down naval invasions, possibly even making the AI rethink their options of naval invasions. And I think they'll work as costal fortresses, haven't played around with these yet. I think this DLC is woth the price and it did climb up to the top of my list of essential DLCs. What this adds is simply amazing me, and it still amazes me as I keep finding new features and content. Conclusion: This is an actual DLC and not an immersion pack. Go and buy it if you haven't, you won't be disappointed",1,0,en

"A story-driven series of 18 puzzles with highly-customizable difficulty to keep things fresh. The main menu options are simply separate sliders for Music and SFX, and Full-screen or Windowed.  Once you start the game, however, the options multiply.  These choices include: Whew!  As you can see, plenty of ways to keep things interesting and increase replayability.  But wait, there's more!  On the actual puzzle there are buttons at the top right to change things up even more.  From left to right: Change image zoom on the background, shuffle puzzle pieces, sound, restart level and exit.  There are a few other changes you can make, but I'll let you discover those on your own. Puzzle pieces will snap into place when you drop them in the right place, and you can zoom in/out using the scroll wheel on your mouse. : After the protagonist's wife dies, he travels the land, desperately seeking a way to bring her back to life.  I have to say that I really loved having a story to tie all of the puzzles together.  Story segments are presented between levels, and can be just a line or two, or several paragraphs! The tale itself was both fascinating and a little macabre, and I'd love to see it fleshed out more.  It would make a great full-length novel or even VN. : The assorted music tracks felt very natural and were lovely to listen to.   I really enjoyed the artwork for the game.  It's dark but beautiful and eerie but hopeful all at the same time.  Completed puzzles will be added to your Gallery, and can be set as wallpapers. : If you play every level with 28-pieces and ignore the story, you can probably finish the game in about an hour... But what fun would that be?  There are  .  and I happily completed them all. This was a really enjoyable experience, and I definitely suggest checking it out... Providing that you like good art, an interesting story and jigsaw puzzles!",1,0,en

"Usually I wait a couple of days of play to write a review for a game. This game i'm making an exception for because of how absolutely stellar this game is.  Here's why. -Tricks have weight/ tangibilty: Many other skateboarding games fail at this. This is such a simple concept many games fail to capture. This game makes tricks mean something. It takes spammability away and is incredibly realistic to real life. -Incredible mod community: Maps and mods are easy to download. The community is always ready to help out your experience in game. For instance, I really didn't like the motion blur effect on the character and it normally isn't removable from the settings menu. However it was through a community made mod that helped me out dividends.  -Can run on actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ setups: This game works well even on my current setup, a 280$ laptop. And it's not even mediocre. It's great. All I had to do was turn the resolution down and it ran swimmingly. As I said before there are plenty of graphics mods as well, so feel free to search mods up as you need them. All in all, This is my favorite skateboarding game for the time being. Absolute 10/10, would definitely recommend.",1,0,en

"Lovingly created and true to the feel of the Half Life franchise. The detailed and immersive level design feels like every pipe, mattress and grate was placed with great care and thought. The Element 120 concept is well thought out and executed. A brief backstory of the goings on can be found in the journal pages scattered across the 4 chapters. I enjoyed the simple yet effective puzzles and the shoot outs were perfectly slotted in to break up the exploration. Although quite short, it was easy to get 100% of the achievements and a real pleasure to step back into the dystopian world I love so much. A perfect fit in the Half Life universe!",1,0,en

"This is a challenge. It drops you straight into the fray and almost doesn't relent. I would suggest using normal difficulty for balance, though it's possible to do on hard also. It has a nice combination of enemies, placement and did very well with combine architecture. Better than the official Combine Citadel.    It would have easily been improved with voicing the raid commander's narration. The story isn't always easy to follow as you're getting shot/moving so often (supposed to read it while this is happening?) It could have also been used to help with the player's pathfinding/puzzle solving at times. Finally the lift could have used some more battery because that thing is SLOW.",1,0,en

"Simply put, Valiant Hearts is a fantastic game. It's mix of simple yet interesting puzzling and storytelling, combined with its gorgeous visuals make a game well worth it's price. While the driving scenes act like a rhythm game, trying to dodge various things popping up on your screen, they don't distract from the overall game.  The story of the first world war is somewhat simpled down to make a game that could be played by a young child, perhaps to teach them about the war. However, the diary and history facts littered throughout the game allow you to delve into the history and the story of WWI. Your faithful canine companion gives some depth to the puzzles, and also a character to feel for and love. Even though the characters themselves aren't developed massively, you can connect with them on a personal level.  Overall, Valiant Hearts gets an 8/10.",1,0,en

The crafting system is fun, I do wish somethings you could craft without a recipe. It is fun discovering different food effects/soups/brews etc. The only thing I dont like is sometimes the annoying bugs I encounter I cant pin point to a single action since you do alot of things in the game which anything could trigger it. It use to be easy to find them but my last play not so much. I do wish smoked items could last longer but trying the dryer method to see if my meats last longer that way, wish there was a small/regular/long/log bamboo rack, additionally I do wish the sound location was a bit better because it terrifies me to hear a spider right near me when I cant see it or locate it via sound easily.  I really do enjoy the game though and will try out story mode out after I get done making my awesome base with my friend.",1,0,en

"With finishing MGS V, I can safely say that it's a very stunning title...if you are the sort of player who loves games that offer you amazing depth in game play mechanics and creating your own scenarios, then stop reading this and go buy this game, you're in for one hell of a ride. With that said if you're more interested about the atmosphere, story, characters, world or exploration, you won't regret passing on this one.  Pros: The game is very polished because of this it has great performance. Excellent game play with amazing flexibility that allows you to tackle missions in a number of different ways. Overall great visuals, animations, voice acting, music and sound design. Cons:  Unfinished main story that fails to provide a sense of direction through majority of the game, plot holes, badly written dialogue at times, mute protagonist and little character development. Bland and unimpressive environmental design and world setting, game would hugely benefit from a change of scenery, especially later on in the game, same applies to overall mission design, which can also get very tedious and repetitive. The credits for every episode are annoying. I mean did you know this game was made by Hideo Kojima? Yeah it's a thing that they took his name off the box, but I'm pretty sure I knew at the start of the game it was made by him. You don't have to remind me.  Overall its a great game through the first chapter after that the game takes a huge nose dive in quality of gameplay. It solely feels like they just made a chapter 2 to extend the overall game time.",1,0,en

My first thought when I opened the game was, ""I don't want to play as this big, ugly fly"" It was not like the screenshots I've seen but the music was nice and I was already in game so I gave it a go. 5 seconds into the game and I was hooked. I'm flying, it feels amazing! Let's see where I can go. The game is simple but enjoyable and it keeps you wondering what lies ahead. By the end I was sitting there in front of my screen with an open mouth. The only thing I could come up was ""breathtaking""  It left me thinking, not only about the fly, but also about myself.

"In Rainbow Six Siege, small tactical choices always lead to big consequences. Every round is a new lesson in what you could have done better, with your mistakes acting as a stern teacher. Taking these lessons to heart and adjusting your team's strategy accordingly keeps each match feeling fresh and exciting, and a drip-feed of new operators, loadouts, and abilities constantly introduces new considerations. The thrill of seeing your plan succeed--whether that's a collection of traps that stops the enemy in their tracks, a well-placed breaching hole that sets the stage for an ambush, or two operators' abilities working together to pull the rug out from the opposing team--is what makes Siege not only a compelling shooter but one of the best examples of teamwork, tactics, and crack shooting out there. Despite its evolution over the past four years, Rainbow Six Siege has always been a battle between attackers and defenders over a single objective. There are five operators per team, each with their own special gadgets that can be used to slow the attackers' assault or poke holes in the defenders' fortifications. Every round, attackers need to move in on a specific objective; depending on the mode, they'll need to sneak in and extract a hostage, create a pathway to secure a specific room, or strategize carefully to defuse a bomb. Bomb is the quintessential Siege mode, as it makes every operator feel viable and balanced. Pushing the objective, finding an opening to plant the defuser, and then protecting said defuser gives the attacking side a steep, rewarding climb to victory, and it's the defenders' job to knock them down and keep them from reaching that summit.",1,0,en

"Short version: This game is good. Buy! Long version: One of the best if not the best combat system I have ever experience. It definitely going to take practice but you wouldn't feel like you are wasting time practicing this game, because the game does such a good job of rewarding your beautiful combo by giving you the satisfaction of hitting max-act and such.  This very deep, complex combat system is the main selling point for me, but for some it might turn them away because they are looking to have fun, not looking to mastering something, and then have fun. DMC 5 is by no mean a game that you have to master to have fun, and it is not as difficult as you might think. You can beat this game if you are not a dead weight. Story wise, it took me around 10-12 hours to complete the story. You might think that is too short for a $60 AAA title. I think so too, but at least it doesn't drag on and on with random quests or filler missions, just straight to the point. Also, replay is a must for this game, so although story is 10 hours, you not gonna be able to keep yourself from playing it all over again with new difficulty. Now this is coming from a person who don't often spend $60 for a relatively new game, especially during this time where triple A games mostly fail to deliver. However, I think that this game is absolutely an exception and that it is very much worth my money P.S: Banana arm = best arm",1,0,en

This game offers good graphics, some nice, enjoyable gameplay, a quite impressive amount of hunters and monsters ,different maps where one of the sides has bigger advantage. AND ITS FREE.

"This game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good, I really wish more people knew the existance of it. Bullet hell synchronized with music is one of the best feelings of the world, for real. I can't describe how good it is, also it is very generous with the coyote timings in between deathbombs. There is also like a shop, where you can exchange score to unlock bonus art and the music room, aswell as Lunatic and Ultra mode, which is honestly a great addition. Not only that, but the patterns are really fun too! like, stage 1 is one of my favorites, not only it is interesting due to the music synchronized with the stage, but also because of the unusual instruments used like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pan flute, truly the best. Stage 2 has a 4secs slow start that makes you think ""ugh, stage 2 zzzzzz"" if it was some Touhou game, but after that 4 seconds without enemies, IT JUST KICKS IN and makes such a fast-paced stage so early into the game it's just so ??? I love it. The third e Also, since the game has an actual Story, pretty similar to EoSD, where you go first 3 stages trying to get into Remilia's castle, well, in here it's basically the same. The third stage is the equivalent of ""Meiling"" and not only does she feels as strong, but the music emphasizes this. Truly a way to show off a ""bodyguard"". Now, stage 4,5 and 6 are inside the castle, so the instruments and the pace of the songs also change BY A LOT Stage 4 has this Sakuya wannabe, which is actually fun, and Stage 5 has the ""end boss"" which even messes up with the UI and it's just so scary, I love her. There is a 6th boss and stage though, but that is unlocked after reaching more than X score, and it really is worth it. I wish I could explain more about this game, but it really is just an experience, and I wish there was a sequel of it, because I really had a lot of fun while playing. Loving every single second of it.",1,0,en

"Hitman: Absolution is one of the letdowns of my fave stealth game series, but it kind of works fine. The narrative is huge here, with a big emphasis on Victoria and a lot less on 47. The gameplay is very good, the instinct system works fine, but its kind of absurd sometimes, and it helps you navigate, too. So that makes the game a lot easier. The story was interesting though in my opinion. The music was not all that memorable, but the mechanics are sometimes off. The checkpoint system is a good addition for longer mission, but it resets everything you did beforehand, so that really confused me at first. All in all, if you like the Hitman series, you might like this entry as well, but if we are talking modern Hitman games, Blood Money and the ones after Absolution definitely win. 8/10",1,0,en

"A surprisingly good RPG with an actual interesting story. Unlike the original Evoland that was more of a fun showcase of game evolution with some minimal story, this one is a full grown classic action RPG. Much much longer and really well thought and deep. Rather than showing gradual game evolution, it changes graphics styles to indicate you travelled through time within the story itself. The game also contains parts that are different game genres and they're well integrated in the whole thing to give you a different kind of experience at times and also offer some fun extra minigames. It's a game full of surprises, but all these pieces are put together so well that I can only praise all the work. I strongly recommend it!",1,0,en

"I'm recommending this game with a big caveat: It's not anywhere nearly as good as Railway Empire. Worth playing for the sake of variety if you enjoy the genre, but there are some design decisions that are really weird. The lack of control over trains pathing can be really frustrating. They implemented signals only a few months after the launch, and even then it's a very barebones implementations (only directional signals). There's no way to make a route go through a specific railway, or use a specific station track. Sometimes a train will change their pathing seeingly at random, and instead of using a direct track that goes from station A to station B, they will decide to follow a track that goes from A to C to B, causing issues for all other trains along the way.",1,0,en

"Saw this hidden gem from my queue.  I owned MW on PSN and it was my favorite game on the PS3. I've been waiting for ages and have given up hopes to ever see this on PC.. BAM! My queue shown this and it was an instant purchase. Pros: - Superior Keyboard and Mouse set up - Game feels natural and didn't play like a port.   - Everything from PSN is here including the online, MP map dlc - Excellent graphic Cons - MP is a bit hard to find games against ppl. Maybe developers can try to integrate cross-platform support to boost up the online community? Final Opinion: If you haven't played Mushroom Wars on PS3, then you should give this a try.  It was one of the best exclusive on PS3 and this port feels natural with keyboard and mouse integration.  I can actually perform more actions and my reaction time is faster as well.",1,0,en
"There are a lot of shooter out there. Most of them try to be original or trying to innovate. In this case, the sum of everything makes a great experience. First of all, the history, even though, it tells something that is difficult to be believed, it is like more like a sci-fi history based on actual event. I mean, what would have happened if Nazi would have won the war... Some parts are extremely exaggerated. I mean, even winning the war, they would have been broken to address fund to develop advance technology and even having the resources, some of the technologies showed in this game would have taken several decades to develop instead of few years. Anyway, despite all of these, I think it was a great experience and great story to follow. Acting of each characters were top notch. Seeing Hitler was very interesting. All were well thought through. Graphics are ok for today standards. Good sound, good effect. In overall, the some of the parts make a great experience and place this game as one of the most rewarding game to be beaten. This game in normal difficulty is playable. Like previous installment, any part was ridiculously hard to go through. I do not recommend to play it on easy because you will loss most of the fun trying to choose proper weapons and strategy to past on.",1,0,en

Your own thoughts are written on the wall and you don't know how to feel and deal with it.  In the end you have two choices ""kill yourself"" or ""help me"". The closer you get to the ""kill yourself"" area, the deeper it gets with much more meaning words.",1,0,en

Its free to play,yes it has microtransactions but personally i never had to put money I spent over 1300 h in game,some say its grind-fest and its true …u get in the same maps, in the same tilesets,with not many changes.So why i still reccomend it ? First,its chillout game,unlike many other games u dont need adrenaline rushing in ur vains.For me its a game to relax.Do i play it alone?no probaply i would get bored easy,i play with a friend of mine Secondly,it gets updated with small updates very often,the tiles dont change,but always new weapons and warframes are added to the game. Also,it has a big player base and unlike many other games out there,pple arent rude nor they are flamming.U will be suprised from how friendly the community is in this game Thats all..dunno if it worths my 1300 h (less i believe it worths it),but for sure its a game to try it out!",1,0,en

But then you start visiting levels like army bases where the only people you're even shooting are police and the military.  Postal had the same problem, you can't immerse yourself in either game because you're either shooting hillbilly cops who somehow have rocket launchers, or you're mowing down dozens of cops without so much as a scratch like you're Chow Yun Fat in the '80s.

"With 50 hours on record on pc,and 500+ on XBOX,i think it's safe to say that i can give a review for this game. :P Chaos Theory,I didn't like when i first picked it up in 2005/2006.Due to me being a child and being nothing like Pandora Tomorrow or the first one.Back then i only played it for Spies vs Mercs,which hands down was the best multiplayer ever.(I know Pandora Tomorrow had multiplayer,but it wasn't popular) Around 2006/2007,I pressed A on Solo play,best decision i ever made.I never really gave singleplayer a chance,but when i played it,i was appalued.It replaced the past 2 games as my favorite! Around 2011,I bought it again for PC...Still hasn't changed.Although,I'm sad to say that multiplayer is offically dead :P (I still log in to see if people still play) Here is my review broken down. Pros: ++Great story,It seems like the game has 2 stories,one about Criminals and the Masse Algothrims,and then Asia and the Masse Algorithms,but it all is collided around 6th mission. +Co-op and SVM is excellent,better than Pandora Tomorrow. ++Dynamic Movement,almost has a sandbox feel. ++Optimized for newer machines ++Replay value if you want 100% ratings on every mission +Shader Model 3.0 supported +Low cost Cons: -Some resolutions are not supported (this is 2005 after all,so forgivable) -Multiplayer is somewhat dead -Some issues that are temporary",1,0,en

"Super Metroid and Castlevania SotN occupy two of my top 3 of all time game spots, and I really enjoyed ESA. Pro -Heavy emphasis on exploration -Sequence breaking -Lots of different and challenging bosses -Good save locations -Multiple endings -Standard but well rounded set of powerups -Much more content that you expect Cons -The resolution randomly stretches across the screen when switching rooms at times. -Overly obtuse end game hints -Although interesting, I'm somewhat unfullfilled by any of the endings This game is about 3-5 hours, but then becomes around 12 hours or more when trying for maximum completion. Some of the obscure end puzzles could be made better with an ingame interface to reference the info without having to go back to the location of the hint or having to write it down. Other hints are in the background, and I think this is part of what might keep some players from finishing the game completely. Once you go through every ounce of the game and see every ending, you find yourself feeling like there was no ""good"" ending. Before playing ESA I had just finished Axiom Verge, and I did not like how obscure the glitch rooms were to find at times. I don't have perfect vision, so seeing minor graphical glitches/scanlines with such a short range was just ridiculous to me. I would compare that to some of the more hidden parts of ESA. I did find ESA to be more layered in terms of exploration than Axiom Verge. This game is very deep, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. However, some of the puzzles are unnecessarily long or obscure.",1,0,en

Still, finding a game and connecting to it should be easier. Also please dont force people to sign up for twitch - kinda sucks that you need a twitch account to play this game!  UPDATE: According to the devs they will be changing all of that in the near future (see comment section)  At this point the game is really promising but still needs a bit of work.

"Still just getting the hang of it. Started a game on normal - got steamrolled. Went on easy and then it was too easy. But then I tried again on normal and had learned enough to make it work. What I'm trying to say is that this game has a bit of a steep learning curve at the start. There's so many elements to consider and a lot of leveling up your stats between matches. Yet when you get past that initial bump, it's pretty good. My initial frustration at losing a level to ""not having the right stats"" instead of ""not understanding the game mechanics,"" went away as I understood that this was what the game was about. Replaying maps, ones you've had an easy time with, using modifiers to challenge yourself and get more exp, to progress further. It feels more like a sandbox with progressive unlocks than a campaign this way, which was not what I expected but what I learned to enjoy. While I'm (at the time of writing this) still in the early stages of the game, it feels as though this sandboxy design is persistent throughout all that I've played. So if you want a slowly progressing TD game about setting up your own challenges, something you can play a couple of sessions here and there while trying to unlock new things, you'll probably enjoy this game. If it feels a little punishing at first; just be patient and try to unlock some of the early skills (like spawning more monsters for bonus exp - great on the easier levels to push the limit and get rewarded).",1,0,en

"The Coalition has really put effort in this one. It maintains the fun aspect in the game-play, although I can't comment about the campaign because I still haven't finished it yet (I play mainly Horde). The part of campaign I have played is pretty faithful to the gears formula. The high stakes are still there in the story. As I have finished Gears of war 3 and Gears of war 4 campaign, I can say the story maintains the spirit of a Gears game. The only reason I haven't finished campaign yet is because I started playing horde mode which I hadn't in gears of war 3 or 4. The horde mode alone is worth buying this game for. Even Escape, another mode in multiplayer co-op is worth playing. The campaign is also fun in co-op. In short this game is worth it even at full price. But you should probably try and get it on sale as it is older now. Its definitely more than worth it on sale.",1,0,en

"I really wanted this game back when it came out. Since I was on an extended gaming break at the time and had an old computer I missed out on it. But it always lurked in the back of my mind. Now I finally have and can emphatically state that the decades wait was worth it... With one caveat. First of all, you must get the unofficial patch, which is easily found and installed. Once that is in place you can start enjoying this absolute gem of a game. It's not the best at any one gameplay element. Melee combat is a bit clunky, ranged combat somewhat underpowered. Stealth is too easy and infiltration a bit simple. But that's exactly the thing - the sheer amount of choice and ways to achieve goals is incredible and puts many far more advanced games to shame. There is very rarely just one way to reach a destination but many. The choice of which clan you belong to (equivalent to choosing a race in standard rpgs) truly matters and makes the game have lasting value. On a new game you can either choose your clan or answer a series of questions to determine the clan. If you decide to buy this game I highly recommend that you answer the questions on your first playthrough. Add to this that the story is pretty good, the plot and progression of the story is great, every choice matters and there are tons of sidequests and you've got a real winner. Highly recommended.",1,0,en

"I am sorry I haven't done this review already but have had a hard time pulling myself away from the game itself. It is very addicting. I have to say this is the type of game I always wanted to play for I have always loved sports statistics. When I was a young boy I collected baseball cards and I loved keeping statistics about baseball and other sports. The part about creating my own league is what really got it for me. Its the type of game I have always wanted to play .   It lets me play the way I want to play. So many games out there make you play a curtain way making you take a certain path but with OOTP20 I can create a league the way I want it. I do have a problem when expanding my league at times. When I want to expand to just 2 teams it forces me to expand to more than 2 because the leagues would be uneven. But it is more realistic to expand to just 2 because it would be a strain on a league to expand to 4 or 6 in a single season. I do recall when the American League expanded in 1977 to 14 teams with the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners but the National League still only had 12 till 1993. I tried to expand my league that way but the game wouldn't let me. But I deal with it.   It is probably the best text based game I have ever played. It is fun and easy to learn. As I play , it seems like I am always learning something new about the game. And there is a lot of guides out there and a great network of people willing to help and answer your questions about the game.  I also enjoy the minor leagues seeing players develop to major league players and being able to take a team in the majors and build it into a dynasty.   So I highly recommend OOTP20 whether you like text based games filled with statistics or are into strategy or playing a game your way with a lot of choices even with structure.",1,0,en

"I love Failbetter and their style. One of my favorite games ever was Sunless Sea. At first I didn't think I liked Sunless Skies, but after a while of playing I found I was really enjoying it. It's not exactly the same as Sunless Sea, but why should it be? I eventually found that Skies has just enough new mechanics, art styles, etc. to make it a new and fun experience. Essentially, it ended up being the perfect mix of 'Different' and 'Same' when comparing it to the last game. I love the new art style & updated combat and the writing is as great as always. It's not as horrifying as Seas, but it's still ominous and still retains an undertone of horror. It's certainly a new feeling for a Failbetter game. Skies just happens to give you a different feeling than Seas.  - Love me some Failbetter games. Skies is a great adventure full of excellent stories and the artwork is beautiful.

"is an indie metroidvania that is set on a sci-fi world where robots and machinery are becoming a trend to humanity, whatever the purpose for them may be. You play as  , a digital ghost who performs mercenary work and was hired by two genius hackers in their attempt to uncover the secrets behind the success of the Nakamura Corporation with their robots. Your mission is to infiltrate the Nakamura Space Station and steal their Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Along the way you will find countless enemies that will try and prevent your progress as well as puzzles that require your patience and creativity to clear. In order for you to progress through the story, you need to clear certain objectives given to you by your clients. Along the way, you are given various options that could improve or upgrade your character. There are   available for you to spend your hard-earned ""energy cubes"" for   You can also gain   by finding them in rooms related in your objectives. These skill points can be distributed to  , which also give certain bonus points to your characters as you distribute them. Another way to further improve your character is by finding   in most rooms by performing a certain action (for example, clearing all of the monsters or unlocking a shortcut door). Once the secret has been unlocked, a burst of ""souls"" will scatter around the map and collecting them will result into an item or power-up for Ghost. The game also has two different modes for you to play in:   and  . Classic mode's play-style retains the feature of previous metroidvania games where the game starts smooth then slowly increases in difficulty as your progress. In this mode, you can also save your progress through certain points scattered around the space station. Survival mode's pace is quicker than classic; you get items and power-ups that earlier than it should though the challenge presented in this mode is the   feature, wherein if you die, you lose all of your progress.     It is a pretty fun experience to having played the game with its comedic and nonchalant way of story-telling and immersive and challenging gameplay. With respects to that, I do recommend the game to everyone who is even remotely interested and am pretty sure that you will enjoy it.",1,0,en

"I broke my spacebar, will break it again  (nah just kidding) you can use the mouse click or up button too. I love the way the map designers made the jumps same to the beat of the background music.  It really gives you the mood that you are into the game. Sad thing is I suck at these kind of games ( because I just don't have the patience in retrying 200 times over and over the same place I die) For those who are like me, luckily they have a practice mode where there are many spawn points to retry from. When you ready, then you can go to the immediate death normal mode.  One thing about the spawns though, because they are programmed I think, not placed by an actual person, so, sometimes you keep respawning in this awkward position, where you are in mid-air, you respawn, and it's hard to get ready for the next jump, so you die like 10 times in a row (within like 20 seconds) . That is the only annoying thing . So it's hard to practice when you don't even know what the fluff is going on. Overall 9/10   :D",1,0,en

"Factorio, for the Zelda crowd. --- I really enjoy resource management games, and this one satisfied my needs. The first few nights I played, I ended up thinking about it drifting asleep and woke up wanting to play again. The humor's on point, it's cute, it has a decent pacing (until the endgame, which... well, I guess there's no real end to a game), and quests are enjoyable. It's not perfect by any means, there are tons of QoL stuff that could help (for example, when your drone hovers above you and is 6 times your size, your character can be a bit hard to see; now imagine having 10 drones), but any solo developer who creates such a strong game deserves high praise.  If you're stuck, don't hesitate to look up stuff online. The Forager wiki on Gamepedia helped me figure out how to get certain rare resources, and puzzles there have clues that can help you guide you along rather than just straight up giving you the solution.",1,0,en

"Half-Life 2 is a game that no fan of first-person shooters should miss. The game is primarily an adventure in which you ""fight the power"" and begin an uprising against a totalitarian and unfeeling alien government that has enslaved the vast majority of the human race into carrying out its various biddings. From whacking cyborg policemen with a crowbar in the first level to manually controlling laser-guided rockets in mid-air to drop two gunships from the sky while your vast army of giant bugs terrorizes the super soldiers residing in the local prison facility, your journey will make you feel as though you're accomplishing a lot. Valve did a great job of designing HL2's levels around rewarding exploration, as well as giving players little resting periods between hectic gunfights to solve physics-related puzzles in order to advance or claim extra goodies in the form of health or ammunition. As for story, the game has more of it than meets the eye; look around and you might find newspaper clippings telling of a ""Seven Hour War""; listen carefully to Dr. Breen (the ""puppet antagonist"") and you might discover why there are no children to be seen in the entire game. Lastly, without giving anything away, I'd like to add that the game's final level STILL, to this day, leaves a lasting impression on me; it is most definitely one hell of a ride. I think the only glaring flaw this game has is its rather vague and abrupt cliffhanger ending (cue Episodes 1 and 2). There are, of course, other smaller issues, like the occasional enemy standing still and accepting your bullets to their face with glee, or the frustrating vehicle controls (yes, there are driving segments, and they don't end quickly). I also wish the game gave the player more opportunities to approach a group of enemies stealthily, as their spidey-senses usually kick in once you've entered the same acre as them. In conclusion, I give Half-Life 2 nine damn cats out of ten. It is truly a treat.",1,0,en

"You maybe thinking, is 5-7 mins of playtime enough to a review a game? Well in this case, it actually is! I even played it twice! This isn't really much of a game, but the cuteness meter is off the charts and who doesn't like cute and cats especially when you combine them? You basically just outfit each cat. Click on the little Santa hats and click on the cat to make them wear the hat. You do have a choice of how to play, you can either do each hat one at a time, or you can even collect all the hats and THEN click on all the cats. Your choice. The game is free and is great for a quick smile for your day. And by the way getting all the achievements is INSANELY easy.",1,0,en

"I tried to make my friends play this many times and they looked at the game with that meh... expression. They mostly never tried it but all thoses who did liked it.  The game Launch like a terraria map where you gotta start every time from scratch* with a factory and explore to find ingredients. Once you're set up, you have to defend your soup factory versus, kinda pirate, I dont know the name but they basicaly try to eat or blow up your base. It mostly base building, base defence, exploration and trying to mix up new combination of ingredients. where the game, get more complex as you unlock more options, ex. vehicles or new robots. The game have a harsh while cartoony embience where you have to compete with rival company as an astro-worker and your boss just want results, he dont care that much about you but you understand this with a type of humor that is quite chaming for a game. This is a sample of one of the jokes you face early on but in my words: Try to not die, every time an astro-worker dies, I gotta fill up a ton of paper and it cost me money to get a new one. The art looks like additions of simple shapes to make your average object with colorfull background that change with planets, The pieces of factory you use are always the same color but as you place them, the art change with a tube placed on one side or the addition of a fan etc..., it not much but it get the job done and I did enjoyed it, the robots you use and your caracter are slightly less squared that the rest of the game but not much. The online is weak not due to a bad interface but more because there isn't that much player at any given time that play online and it a shame for the effort that was given to make it simple and working. when you do manage to find some one it half of the time some random dude at the other side of the globe and when it does happen, the connection is as bad as the sexyness of a blobfish. If you play with friends nearby, it can support up to 4 players. *I said from scratch but you do unlock new technologies with completed games. ** Sorry for my bad english if I made some mistakes, im french but I wanted this to reach a broader audience.",1,0,en

"This is a retro style game. If you don't like pixel graphic, you won't enjoy it. It has nice story, there are many, many, many areas that you can explore.  The music fits the game perfectly.  The controls are simple, but you will need a while to get how everything works, cause the tutorial is bad (at least i didn't get it). The gameplay is really addicting. The crafting system is easy, so you won't have much trouble with making new items. The game itself is great, but there is a lack of guides, so you will need to learn everything by your own. Besides from bad community, i really recommend that game :D Buy it if it is -50%!",1,0,en

"Vanity over vanity and all is vanity. Geralt is not a hero, but an outcast, in a world that does not accept mutants.. but frankly, he does not accept humans either. The monsters will perform best in it, specifically the two-legged ones, without claws, teeth and conscience. The ones that the right witcher shouldn't kill. Although I was saving people, villages and the whole world, I was constantly greeted in the back of my head by the knowledge that nobody really didn't deserve to be saved, because he was a evil bastard, or he might not want to save, because his existence was nothing else anyway. than constant suffering, even if it is not eaten by a ghoul. And it's not easy to build such a rough atmosphere. It is no wonder that one feels uncomfortable in a dilapidated sub-castle, where hellhounds appear every night, or in a city devastated by a plague epidemic. But she had exactly the same effect on me as the feverish sunny fields, which would be beautiful in another game. In the Witcher, rot emanates from them. Of course, this is an ambitious project for its time and the possibilities of the company. It's actually a wonder what the CD Projekt was able to put together in the first game. At the same time, I'm glad that they weren't afraid to push the saw and moved the whole series to where it is today. Much further than 13 years ago.",1,0,en

"While a very barebones port with only having options of 'off and 'on' in the graphical settings, the game surprisingly works quite well for me. In my 5 hours of playthrough from the prologue to the beginning of Chapter 2, i didnt encounter a single crash, nor stuttering framerates, it was always at a constant 60. I played at highest settings with all options set to 'on' at 1080p with borderless window ( I like to Alt+Tab quite a bit). Thats not to say NISA should stop rolling out patches, anything can happen later on. Gameplay-wise spectacular job done by Falcom, this is one of their best looking game yet and quite probably the only game where I love grinding. Its such a blast laying waste to enemies with different combos and characters, combat is fast paced as usual. The only thing I have a gripe about is the Switch getting the all-DLC included version including the exclusive pirate and swimsuit costumes. While I dont particularly mind the generic ingame items dlc that can be obtained via farming, I do want to at least get those costumes here on the Steam version. (Literally the one time where swimsuits would actually make sense in the story) EDIT: Encountered my first major glitch, weird screen flickering in the Coral Forest (chapter 2). Really annoying.....wheres that damn patch!? EDIT 2: With the recent patch , the flickering seems to have been fixed. I'll still maintain that in my 35 hours of game time the game didnt even crash ONCE. Maybe the Maiden of the Great Tree is on my side :P",1,0,en

"Great game all tho you are better off buying the new Redux version since it gives your character new nice cyber katana and very helpful  dash movements, along with that you get better visuals but enough about Redux, this is about classical, and let me tell you its vicious on  higher difficulties to the point which made me put this game away  for a couple of times because i was stuck on some levels. Playing this game on Insane ""Heroic"" mod was a real challenge.  Basically insane difficulty + one life per level. You mess up you start from start of the level. Another thing that didn't help the heroic run was the fact that enemies where absolute bullet sponges. However good news for those who like to get game done, there is a work  around although it defiets the purpose of ""Heroic"" challenge ;) Wopens Game has 12 weapon (configurations) that can be switched to on  the run at any given moment which is nice to see the old school weapon pulling out of your arss system. With that you get a go to upgrade them, to either do something faster or have very cool module that can x-ray through obstacles like your father when he  knows your not sleeping and playing games.  Smart pants inspector gadget  Did i mention Elon Musk will become the worlds leading chip implant competitor but only after Mr. Bill will make it a standart. Anyways you can upgrade your character with fancy schmancy  implants that allows you to simulate hard attack, by slowing  down time and make your vision all matrix like with vibrant colours OR.. or or if you are into collecting things there is this cyber cookie  detector that tells you where are all the cookies on the level..  now thats smart if you ask me. Also also.. what else.. ahh yeah it has a story. Music is ok, it dosn't rip off you cloths. Review note 01/10/20 Improve text spacing/format. Steam was playing tricks with me.

"This story isn't only about a mental illness and madness that resides in one's mind, this is about facing death and losing the most important person in your life. This is about being your worst enemy. There's nothing that can hurt you more than your own voices in your head that keep telling you that ""You'll never be good enough"" and ""Just give up"" and just keep laughing and berating you. Nothing's more cruel than your own hate towards yourself. Calling this work of art a ""videogame"" wouldn't do it justice. You can treat this game as a psychological horror, puzzle or even a walking simulator. Doesn't matter what label the game deserves, it's the story and the immersion that will hook you on Hellblade. Rest assured, there are no cheap jumpscares. Everything in this game is real enough just to make us understand that a human's mind is truly complex and will always stay a hidden mystery. It's impressive how far Ninja Theory went with their interviews and discovered more about psychosis. I watched the video that was included in the game's menu and it was fascinating. Such an interesting concept and brilliant execution. I love Senua and I was glad to see her happy at least in one of her memories. It was such an emotional piece to go through, I loved each and every moment of it. Reminded me of Dante's Inferno. I know it'll keep me thinking in the future.

"F.E.A.R. or First Encounter Assault Recon, is a psychological horror first person shooter, amazingly well designed and one of the few games that always made me feel uneasy while playing it. This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it.  You play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created.  The story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable. F.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more.  Alma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself.  The game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart. F.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget. The Good -Creepy Atmosphere -Amazing story -Visuals, Sound and Particle system -Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games -Enemy AI is brilliant -Good selection of weapons The Bad -Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing -Could have used a little more variety in the environments 9.5/10",1,0,en

"CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.",1,0,en

The overall depth of the game is the main strength, and anyone that has interest in history and turn-based stragegy will find it engrossing. Really, the array of possiblities of eventual life is infinite, and this game allows that presecent to breathe.  The major downside of this game is the marketing. It's the DLC concept that makes me mad. It's a great product, but they want you to spend like $100 dollars to get the full thing. I waited for sales, but still it's the same. Back to the game, it's good and fun and you will waste hours where you say in your mind, ""Well, just one more turn.""

"One of the most fantastic experiences in a survival mission based out there. If you loved the Left 4 Dead formula and appreciated the richness of a problem solving ever changing game, keep an eye on this as it leaves early access very soon to 1.0. Early Access short experience: I've actually am blown away by the software stability and optimization along with a full random generated map. Every. Single. Mission. Will play differently. The random generated map engine has a few pre defined area types but a tons of variations making every single chamber, hallway, hole extraordinarily different. Quite a few things to tweak out here and there, and seeing the developer being so active at tweaking values and optimizing, it is guaranteed the experience will be taken care of. Nothing is perfect. So is this game. Some models here and there are not really well done through out the scenery objects (non gameplay related) and so on. The gameplay satisfaction is stunning and the gun play is pretty decent. You can make the game harder or easier and if your team dies and mission fails, you take nothing back home. Ammunition should be considered and you should look for minerals to call in a supply drop to replenish bullets and bombs in order to keep on track of whatever mission you are in. Missions varies from a lot of different subjects; from rescuing M.U.L.E.S. (robots that carries minerals for you as your mineral bag is finite) to collecting minerals to a fortified ""base"". From killing a few bosses to collect certain mineral and get out alive. The maps are situated in a few diverse types of landscape. Each one with different rules like lava, sandstorm, radiation etc. Also there are random 'mutators' like effects on each mission so the variety of gameplay is absurd with all this on top of a randomly generated cave system. And a lot more on character progression and events... The freshest game I've played lately. Super recommend it!",1,1,en

Now you can't just go to Cherno or to the NWAF to have a quick, intense and fun battle, now you have to look for so much food to even survive your trip to the NWAF and by the time you reach your destination you remember it is 2018 and you can't just battle on the airfield to have some fun because you will lose all your stuff.

The developer also does a lot of work, making this game the greatest he can, but he can't do it alone, he does it with the help of the community that future players can be apart of. This game is definitely something I have and will in the future suggest to players that like these types of games.",1,0,en

"I wanted to love Test Drive Unlimited 1, but there were something missing about this game, hours spent in game untill servers were shut down on 9/29/2012 . Thats where TDU2 comes on. It lets you live the life of a pro racer on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. It combines traditional racing with an open-world, always-online (except when it's not) multiplayer setup that makes it easy to interact with others. You can even buy property on the island, decorate said property, and show off your exotic car collection to your friends. Doesn't it all sound fantastic? The ideas that went into Test Drive Unlimited 2 are appealing in every way P.S. Over 1,5k hrs spent online,and once more unluck me website dont respond and not leting change password, nothing ealse but to buy new copy of game, #BackToGame  As far as i see after 6 months breake SERVERS ARE STILL ON so feel free to buy the game, you'll never get bored..",1,0,en

"I ran out of blood grenades, so I p*ssed on a giant oily squid monster to try and kill it but I ended up dying because I couldn't stop laughing. Kojima you beautiful b*stard. Pis* jokes aside, Death Stranding is fun and it kept me hooked until the very end. It's got a fantastic story, amazing world building, and beautiful motion-capture graphics. The characters are animated beautifully by their respective actors with Mads Mikkelsen as Cliff demonstrating what is in my opinion, one of the best portrayals of a villain in all of gaming (You'll really wanna see where his story goes).  The gameplay may be boring to some but if you have Spotify open and put on your favorite playlist you'll enjoy it much more. There is a system where you manage your cargo and how it affects your balance but there's a function that has the game auto-arrange it for you to lessen your cargo's effect on your balance. If you keep losing your balance and falling just hold down the right and left mouse buttons as you walk and you won't fall (It's slower but much more efficient). You can get over encumbered as well but it gets nullified pretty early on with a certain item that you get. If you want to get around the world faster, then you can always take a bike (I highly recommend this in the   Region).  There are also a few stealth sections with BTs (Beached Things), invisible ghosts that you can spot with your BB (Bridge Baby). You have to hold your breath when you're near them and you can get through them with some patience. They get much easier later on when you get better weapons though. The big feature of Death Stranding is the Chiral Network, a mechanic which allows you to see other player's structures (ladders, climbing anchors, bridges, roads, etc...) and also allows them to see your structures. You can like people's structures to appreciate them and give them points which increase their level and give them extra abilities as they play. It also feels very gratifying when you see that other people used your structures and liked them as well. You also have the ability to entrust some cargo that you need to deliver to other players so that they can finish the job (they can do the same to you), however, this feature is entirely optional, so you're not obligated to deliver anyone else's lost or entrusted cargo. The game has got a great soundtrack as well which unfortunately only plays at specific moments throughout your journey with you not being able to listen to it while travelling, however, when you rest in your private room you are given the choice to listen to music. This isn't much of a problem though since the whole soundtrack is on Spotify (see link below): 505 games did an excellent job optimizing the game because I didn't encounter any bugs and had only a few FPS dips throughout the game. Bravo. Overall, the game is really solid and I highly recommend checking it out. If you're not having fun at first, wait until you get to the   Region which is when the game really picks up (it's about 8 hours in). I applaud both Kojima Productions and 505 Games for bringing an excellent game to life, and I also applaud Sony for allowing Hideo Kojima to make the game he wanted without any interference on their part, something unfortunately rare in this industry.",1,0,en

"Note: Basically requires a controller. I personally reccomend an Xbox One controller. I have a steam controller but I just dont really like it. Game is visually stunning, and grabs your attention right off the bat and keeps you playing. Whether it be for exploring every nook and cranny in an area, to figuring out how to beat that boss that you keep dying to, this game has a lot of content. Definately worth the money.  There are stories and people saying they were banned for using controller mappers / hackers invading their game and corrupting their save files. This has not happened to me yet, hopefully it doesnt but I cannot say my opinion on this matter.

"Alright, since there're only positive reviews out of nowhere, i'll give it a negative one to balance it out since steam doesn't want to give us a neutral review button. Pros: +An alright in-game design +Nice voice acting for a project like this +The ambient and soundtrack are nice Cons: - Animation is a joke starting with the intro cutscene - Perfomance is horrible for no absolute reason - Common visuals for a cheap unity horror - Default Unity's interface - Absolutely disgusting chasing sequences including poor designed ""notes"" like in Slender - Problems with in-game objects scale, everything feels wrong So-so: It's crystal clear that Distorted Games were highly inspired by the Silent Hill franchise while making this game, it seems that they (or most likely the only developer) didn't understand what made Silent Hill a great game. The scenery in Near Death Experience, soundtrack and the atmosphere reminds you of SH, but at the same time they doesn't provide you anything new except poor gameplay and first person perspective. The puzzles are the same, the theme of the game is the same as SH and i would say that it's an absolute rip-off, but i feel like i craved those grim features and the mood of hopeless town of Silent Hill since it was a long time without new games in that spirit. I bought this game as a joke and altought i didn't think i would like some aspects of it, i did. Maybe, if you buy it as a joke you will find it alright as well. I wish Distorted Games will continue to make games and improve their skills, and i hope i will recommend you to buy their new creations.",0,0,en

My friend told me to get it and I was like ""eh whatever I'll try it"" and it's one of my favorite PC games now. 6/16/20 I have not played this game since 2016.  The ending was very bad, you will be disappointed with all of your hard work.  It amounts to nothing more than a vanilla Minecraft server in the sense of how much the game will provide.  It's a dangerous sandbox, lacking a shred of linear gameplay.  I am switching it to a thumbs down, because I in fact do not recommend that you play The Forest in the 2020's.",0,0,en

People overthere crying and saying that classmates are unplayable and killer is OP, well you can't 1v1 a killer, you hardly can 5v1 a certain killer without right equipment, but everyone is playing wrong and overreacting.  Nvm, devs ruined it, the only changes I agree with are medic buffs and some weapon damage buffs, insta nightmare shield regen to full after you vanish also stupid everything else wasn't needed, you can 1v1 mash button against killer now again and get free kills.

"Pretty terrible in almost every way possible especially by Arkanes standarts. While the story in main Dishonoured games was always secondary and rather simplistic this time we are introduced to stupidity and complete lack of motivation to go after the main ""villian"" too. The standalone addon doesn't even deserve the name because the only reason why you're trying to murder the Outsider is not because he killed your lover and kidnapped your child or took over your empire. Nah, you're going after him because your buddy whom you haven't seen for 10 years asked you to do so. So you swear a Vendetta and for no apparent reason become able to kill a god. Pretty much every characters established by the previous games are butchered for the sake of the horrible story. The Outsider, who was a mysterious, omnipotent being became a whinny little dude whos only line of text is ""I didn't ask to be a god, uaahhh.""or Daud who became equally whinny and just embarrassing by blaming his actions on others. The gameplay lacks in every way possible, what D1 and D2 made great is now gutted for no proper reason but to make the game more accessible for the mindless masses. The mana bar regenerates and cannot be refilled with items which severly limits your movement and freedom because if you move to fast, you have to sit there and wait until you're full on mana again. There are only 3 powers which are reskins of the original counterparts and you can't upgrade those so exploring the mission area brings you no reward. Only 5 missions of which 3 are in the same new area and one reuses a level from Dishonored 2. And they even removed the chaos system so the replayability of the addon is almost non existent because the only thing that changes now is the ending. You can save and reload at the end of the game and see everything it has to offer. Basically Mass Effect 3 ending. The only good thing about this addon is the optimization. I'd say stay away from this one or buy it at half price atleast  like I did if you're a hardcore Dishonored fan.",0,0,en

"Originally, I believe that this game was an amazing game with some bugs, glitches, and script-kiddies. while back when i wrote my 1st review i would agree, I am now shifting my opinions to the other side. GTA5 had its problems, and bugs that have been around since launch. Back when i first got this game, The bugs weren't too common, and i maybe encountered a modder once every 10 sessions or so, and even then, about 1/2 of them were the kind to change the weather and drop money. I didn't want any of their money, but i don't mind the weather changes, and i was ok with staying in. Ever since they gave out the game for free, everything has changed. Almost every server I encounter some kind of modder now. Almost all of them are teleporting around, killing people, exploding the servers, crashing my game, trapping the session, getting rid of our ammo, putting fires inside our avatars, ect. ect ect. In about 1/2 servers i join, I tend to encounter a glitch that puts me permanently into a loading screen or waiting for a mission to start, thereby making me restart my game.  I see more modders on a daily basis than i see tryhards trying to kill people for their KD I've had to start playing in solo-public sessions or invite only because of the rampant modder issues and R* refuses to fix any of it. I have been tempted to hire a modder to just keep me safe in a lobby from other modders. im sure their is some kind of service somewhere. I love this game's concept, and I think it is a game worthy of the title ""Best game"" if they fixed SOME of the issues. But R* has shown that they don't care about the modders or the glitches that make playing their game impossible. They only care about the money glitches that prevents shark card sales. I know my review is only a review. I know that no one is gonna look at this and have a change of heart or care. If you want to buy the game, make sure you are mainly playing with friends right now, or learn how to make solo-public sessions. the amount of issues right now makes this game unplayable solo in a public lobby.",0,0,en

"This does it for me.  I am not going to buy anymore UbSoft games anymore.  I am throughly done with this rip off garbage. I come back years later to play this game, and the Launcher basically won't let me play a game that I paid money for! I had to regisiter key with Steam, then register again with Ub Launcher; but it would not let me register with the launcher (saying that another player is using the key... which I just used on STEAM).   And years ago when I tried; the Ub Launcher was not here; so I only had to put in my Steam key.  I remember being able to play this game back then. This current Launcher is crap though, it basically prevents game owners from playing Anno.  And then I am reading reviews here dating far back.  And UbSoft has not fixed their Launcher???  And players are STILL having these difficulties and not being able to play a game that they bought? This makes me pretty mad actually. I tried going through some support help, but nothing is working.  The best recommendation that I got was ""go find a pirated crack"", or ""Go find a way to reprogram (crack) the launcher"".    No.  I am not going to waste my time doing that for a game that I paid for.

"This used to be my favorite game of all time. Not anymore ______________________________________ The current state of Team Fortress 2 right now is BAD You will see cheaters/hackers in casual matches and maybe competitive too The only way to play this game is by community servers, which I usually don't like them, because most of them have confusing plugins, level system, or even custom sounds and custom effects. If you're a new player, I suggest finding a good community server you are comfortable in and do NOT play casual mode as it is bombarded with hackers and VAC doesn't do anything. The community of Team Fortress 2 has also gotten worse. It is rare to find a FRIENDLY player nowadays and it is unwelcoming to new players, perhaps the in-game tutorial was not enough to teach them advanced techniques (Rocket Jumping, Sticky Jumping, etc). At last, I do not recommend to play this game, for now. You will face a lot of hackers if you play it right now. When Valve fixes the current issues, feel free to play this game!",0,0,en

"Best Friend Forever is a visual novel dating sim coupled with dogs, sound like a winner right? Unfortunately what looks good on paper is executed poorly here.  The gameplay of Best Friend Forever is a very generic point and click dating story where you take of dogs in between. The characters are dull and the dialouges downright cringeworthy sometimes. The romances are also not given time to build up and feels extremely rushed. It took me around 2 hours to complete a selected route while taking care of the dog activities. Speaking ofdog activities, the dog part of the game feels tacked on just to appeal to more people. The care you take of your dogs does not effect the game in any significant way and its purely added for the sake of it. Since the characters are mostly bland, the short journey you take through the game is also farily bland. There is no spark between characters or a real feeling releatonship between you and your dog and it ends before it starts so the gameplay here is not good.  Visually Best Friend Forever, in my opinion, is not good. It goes for a cutesy artstyle but most of the characters and animations come off as jarring to say the least. The only thing I liked about the visuals here are the backgrounds and they are usually covered off by some bad looking characters. Some people might like this kind of visual style, it simply does not look good to me. Like the rest of the game, fairly generic. It does its job but you won’t remember it after the game is over. For this price tag, you can do far better than Best Friend Forever. It is short, generic, characters are bland and the story is incredibly rushed. It’s better to look for something else as there are far superior dating sims available for the same price.

"Ive played this game a lot , back in the day on xbox360, so dont be fooled by the 2.2 hours on record. This one is tough for me as i do like this game and i loved the AVP games that came before this one!  I do recommend this game, especially if youre fan of the first AVP games (screw the movies, theyre garbage) Nothing like racing across walls and ceilings and air ducts, as a living H.R.Giga-rian nightmare, stalking your next meal. Great fun.... however.... im giving it a ""NOT RECOMMENDED"" because........ for ME, there is one FATAL flaw in this game. ONE, TINY little thing that basically ruins it for me completely! For those who have played the great, most recent Batman gameS, youll know that you sometimes enter a large room, there are maybe 10-15 guards and you have to take them out one by one to continue. Well , in the Batman games, when you ""get rid"" of the guards, the ones that remain, become more nervous. They know their buddys are being taken out by Batman. They become panicky. When there is only 1-2 of them left they get nervous, scared, their heart rate goes way up, you can jump scare them with baterangs, make them shoot out of sheer panic and fear into shadows.... great fun and excellently done by the game devs!..... WELL..... in AVP, you have a similar situation..... youre playing the scary spooky creepy Alien, and you are in a room full of marines, and you need to take them all out in order to continue. Very similar situation. Here is the thing: The marines DONT get nervous OR scared..... KNOWING that they are up against an ALIEN. The marines dont notice that their buddys are gone / dead. You kill all but one marine, and he still tells his fellow marines to ""watch their backs"" and to ""not let their guards down"".  It may be dumb, but ...... with Batman they are scared to death..... with the ALIEN they should be thinking about changing their underwear. FOR ME, that just breaks immersion and doesnt make sense and doesnt work and is just wrong. ive always wished for a simple patch that would change that, make them behave like the AI in the batman games, but *siighh* it never came.

I was expecting a lot more form this game to be honest. The cars feel numb and they don't slide around corners. It's like driving on tarmac.

"Wow, This is exactly how NOT  to remaster a game.

"Lol, making CS:GO free and adding battle royale doesn't make your cheater-riddled game any better, if anything you have made it worse, well done. You've made it easier for cheaters to access Prime matches; a paywall didn't stop them from buying the game before so why would a cheaper paywall to play Prime stop them now.  Oh and by the way, never make a paid game free to play if it still has a huge active community. All of those people didn't buy and support your game for you to make it free when players become less interested in it, it's just a huge slap in the face.

"If you a big fan of stealth games then you should stay away from this game at any cost and save your money. My first playthrough of this game is just horrendously unpleasant, the animation(how your character moving) is bad making stealth super anoying in some situations. It's impossible to shoot enemies with your sniper rifle without being noticed(occasionally your shot can be covered environmentally) and you will have to relocate all the time after every single kill which is really exploitable(shoot ➙ run ➙ hide) that alone would makes stealth your second option to finish a mission most of the time .

"One of the worst RPG's currently available on Steam - bound do a ridiculously low resolution in either a tiny window or stretched fullscreen mode - most assets are shared over all 3 games, meaning they pretty much charge money 3 times for the same content - no setting menu at all - story and character progression is barely existent. You just grind the same maps until you are strong enough to defeat the only boss in the whole game - pay2win concept by locking characters with ""booster"" (= easy win) packs behind overpriced DLC's",0,0,en

Story and dialogues are from the 90's mediocre action movies Multiplayer is basically random mods of the Unreal Tournament FPS changes between 120-400, and any given FPS it feels sluggish and basic Whole experience feels like this game was made for 12-16 year olds in mind.

"Well, I've just completed this game in about 5 hours total on lunchbreaks, and frankly, I don't see what the excited reviewers are talking about. The game is way too short. It's a game with 3 levels and one shop overworld area. That's it. Once you complete it, I don't see why you'd bother replaying it, there's no multiplayer or even some cool New Game + mode, although upon completing the game it teases you with a ""new"" looking main character. Unfortunately, it's also WAY too easy. The enemies are laughable. Even the potentially dangerous kamikaze robots leave powerups behind, so basically, even if a kamikaze targets you, there's a 33% chance you'll just get your life back in a powerup. Come on... The rest of the enemies are basically a joke, a nuisance at best. The laser traps are quite deadly but aren't ever used in a way that leaves you puzzled. That's actually the problem with the entire game, there's no real puzzle element at all. The only ""puzzling"" you'll see is poking around for a tile (Zelda bombable walls style) to break and reach a secret area. The spelunking mechanic, while addictive and cool in theory, is actually quite shallow. It might seem like digging your way down efficiently requires effort but it really doesn't. If you can put two and two together, you'll figure out how to dig the mine properly in 10 minutes. Finding treasures? Not only is it easy enough initially, you eventually pick up a powerup that just displays every single treasure on the map, pretty much turning your exploring into running through a checklist, so yeah, a chore instead of a challenge. Oh yeah, and the story? Well there isn't one. You jump into a mine built by your uncle or something and everyone is like oooh, what could be there... And then you finally stumble upon a menacing area that looks like something out of Metroid and you finally think oooh... some depth in the story finally? But nope, the final boss is some random-ass contraption named Vectron or whatever, you beat it and you're supposedly assimilated with a new technology, and you get the main menu... Seriously, I'd rather have this game be entirely abstract than have this lazy-ass attempt at a story that tries to put steampunk and futurism together in the most vanilla way possible. Anyway... My personal rating would be 5/10 as in absolutely mediocre and not really worth your money. Not recommended.",0,0,en

"Truth be told, I've never been a huge fan of the M&B series, mainly because the difference between each of the releases seems to be quite minimal. I remember playing the first iteration and thinking there's really not that much to do and now I'm playing this release and I think the very same thoughts - the little the game has to offer is cool and all, but it's just way too shallow for my likings. Go to point A, pick up one of the 10ish quests the game offers, go to point B, finish the quest (unless it bugs out) and gain reputation, go to point C and repeat. Encounter some enemies here and there, defeat them and gain experience/loot or lose and get imprisoned for a couple days. Eventually, join a fraction or create your own and repeat the aforementioned steps. Spice it up with an occasional tournament, which is basically an easy money grab even on the hardest difficulty (realism), once you understand the mechanics, all this becomes a breeze. Apart from that, another complaint I have is that everything seems to take ages, leveling is unnecessarily long - I've played nearly 20 hours and I've barely unlocked any traits, now I don't mind long games as long as they're entertaining, but doing the same stuff over and over again in Bannerlord isn't as entertaining as I had hoped. Combat is great as it is in all M&B games, but again it's the same old with very little difference when compared to Warband - the one major improvement are large scale battles, no more loading every X units killed, instead literally every unit that joins a combat fights until death or escape. Being able to fight in a 1000 vs 1000 unit combat is truly something else. The game also seems to be running pretty well considering the size of some battles, although I've noticed some lag issues in such large scale battles on higher graphics quality settings. I'd recommend the game if there were more interesting features to it, but as of now it's all about combat and everything in between seems like almost pointless filler content. I suggest waiting for full release and decide then, if the game's worth your money.",0,1,en
"I avoided this game because of the release of it. You all remember ""A sense of pride and accomplishment."" We all do. I only got this because it was on sale for $20 and did some research. Turns out they've removed micro transactions from the game completely, and now you only gain an advantage over other players through playing the game. Overall, it's a 7/10 for me. It's a fun Battlefield game, but the customization doesn't feel as solid as it could be, and some there's not many modes to play. I'd like a couple more types to add to variety, but it's still fun overall. Update! It's 4 months later, and the lobbies are pretty empty. There's usually just one match running, and -surprise surprise- it is full, which means you'll sit in the lobby with a couple others, unable to start because there are not enough players. Considering this issue, I'd have liked to see the developers allow empty lobby slots to be filled by AI players so that you can still play the game on slower nights. Sadly though, the developers have stated the game is exactly what they want it to be at, so no future updates. 4/10 for Dev's imagination, and I do not recommend buying any longer now that the main staple of the game is not playable without getting lucky.",0,0,en

"This review may only be temporary. Here's hoping. NOTE: If you're wondering about playtime, It's because I'm a heavy user of offline mode. Always-on DRM strikes again. So I finally downloaded the full retail version after playing the open beta and decided to play through the story mode before going back into multi. It gave me a choice of six options for how I wanted my Warden to look. I picked one with armor I didn't really like since it has a symbol that I did like, only to get in game and find that it didn't even use the symbol it had shown me. Seems simple enough, I'll just go back and pick the armor I liked the look of then. Or not. After looking around the ingame menus for a while I came to the conclusion that there isn't any way to change the appearance you picked at the start. Anywhere. OK, so I'll just restart story mode from the beginning. Or not. There's no ingame option to start a ""New Game"". Anywhere. OK, then I'll just go find my save data and delete it. Problem solved. Or not. After searching extensively through every folder I've ever seen games save to, users, steam\userdata, local, roaming, ubisoft game launcher, my documents, my saves, etc. and doing several searches across multiple hard drives, all I came up with were two ini files for graphics and control options. I even searched through my registry. So I figured I'd ask on a forum. Surely someone on the internet must have found the save location. Or not. After getting a few suggestions of places I already checked, someone came in and said it was probably stored in the cloud. I thought to myself, ""surely not"", as I have cloud saving disabled in both Steam and Uplay and always have. And I'm only looking for the single player save file, not the multiplayer one. I'll simply set both Steam and Uplay to offline mode and prove that the saves must be located somewhere on my local machine. Or not. The game won't even launch if Uplay is in offline mode. So it appears that random forum user was correct. I'll have to contact Ubisoft support to get this resolved. Surely they can reset my save, or failing that, it should be a simple matter to just delete it so I can start over. Or not. After waiting over five hours in line, I finally got to chat with a human being who could actually do something about this. Or not. According to my support agent, Ubisoft in incapable of changing my characters appearance, or of even deleteing my single player save game. And they have no plans to add such a feature. So in conclusion, the unnecessary use of always-on DRM for the single player portion of the game, combined with the ridiculous omission of a simple way to change your character or even to start a new game from scratch, combined with slow and unhelpful customer support means I have to give this a negative rating for the time being. And that's without even getting into the pay-to-not-grind aspects of the multiplayer, or the connectivity issues and hassles trying to get friends to actually be able to join the same game, etc. Or the price. Here's hoping they fix this and I'm eventually able to focus more on the gameplay and multiplayer issues rather than dealing with idiotic feature omissions, bad tech support, and always-on DRM.",0,0,en
"I really want to recommend this game, I really do, but is has so many problems I cannot in good conscious recommend this to anyone. The game itself is very much bare bones without much replayability. It gets repetitive and tiresome after a while without much to do. The disease operates as if it is conscious and will typically choose the best option that it can within' its power regardless of the difficulty level. Don't get me wrong, I can do most scenarios on the hardest difficulty with the right strategy, but it is very offputting that the pathogen's AI makes the best choices it possibly can. IE you have it virtually entirely contained but 1 set of cities leads the pathogen open so it will infect the city to escape quarantine and immediately spend all of its actions stretching as far away from your operatives and containment as it can. Maybe in the future I will come back to it and if it has more content for replayability and the AI is toned down or randomized a bit, then I will recommend it.

"Polyventure, while having great music and some immersive environments is a very experimental, EXTREMELY minimalistic game. While I am a fan of experimental, abstract, and minimalistic walking sims this game simply doesn't have enough depth to it beyond enjoying a few chill songs while wandering around static, somewhat ethereal environments.  Polyventure seems to be more or less just about wandering around strange locales while a chill ""Pure Moods"" ish sounding song plays in the background. While I was initially very captivated with the game and its opening Enigma - Sadeness sounding tune, it quickly became apparent that the game involved very little (to no) player interaction, instead consisting of the player meandering aimlessly about while a snippet of a song plays, looking at a few things (are all of the environments shown in the trailer?) before being warped out of that environment and onto the next ""hub"" area which has 4 pillars of colorful light (seen in the trailer) that the player can walk into. These are all unique but once inside of them there is no purpose to the player to complete (which is fine...) but save for one area involving some optional platforming along clouds there doesn't seem to be any player interaction required at all in Polyventure. Although I still enjoyed the music and can admire Polyventure as a piece of interactive ""art"" or as an interesting way to market the musical tracks, I can't recommend it at its baseline asking price of 4.99. Had the songs also been packaged into a soundtrack on Steam, then it would be a kind of cool experimental EP to pick up, however marketed in its store description as ""a game based on beautiful atmospheres and lucid dreaming, to concern about endangered species and the enviroment"" is injecting far more purpose into the title than is evident to any of the player during their sparse interactions with the level design.",0,0,en
"For starters, this game suffers both in the multiplayer co-op sense and versus, including the shop system. In this game you can be 4 different classes: Soldier, Medic, Engineer and Sniper. But considering how fast-paced the game is, it might as well be Soldier, Medic and Engineer.  The missions are repetitive and boring. PvP is best described as ""who is the best slider with a shotgun"" since it all boils down to who can make a ground slide and shoot with a shotgun faster.  The show is simply a mess. You have to play a lot to first unlock a gun, then have the necessary funds to buy said weapon. After a while, said weapon breaks down and you have to play some more, to earn money, and pay to get that weapon/equipment repaired.  Boring, repetitive, non-innovative.

"Pros - It's Castlevania - Includes Japanese Versions and that's about it Cons - Includes Japanese Versions, but the achievements don't work for them. - Bad emulation (you can find better online for free) feels sluggish - Horrible controls if you are using keyboard and they have no option to change them - Lazy port.

"I really did like this game, the story was interesting and we got to see the ties between AC 4 and AC 3, with other references and details to past AC games, however the reason why I have to give a negative review is the gameplay. - More than a few times I encountered unresponsive controls that either killed me, or made me restart a mission which was annoying, but livable, none were game breaking. - The AI seems dumber than Black Flag, which is impressive - Almost everything from Black Flag was copied and pasted, with a few changes - The game is a muddy mess that can't decide if it wants to be AC 3 or AC 4   It takes almost everything great from AC 4 (my favorite AC game) and makes them slightly worse SHIP GAMEPLAY: -AC4: Cannot volley cannon fire but the cannons make up for it in damage, cannot free aim swivel gun but automatically aims at weak spots and does a good amount of damage, swivel gun during boardings dont have many shots but can shoot through the sides of the ship, cannons take too long to reload but it's livable because the smoke from the shots obscure your vision until they are reloaded -Rogue: you fire a second volley but the volley doesnt do damage, can ONLY free aim your swivel gun and does a lot less damage, swivel gun has a lot more shots during boarding but cant shoot through the sides of the ship making it almost useless while boarding larger ships, the cannons reload slightly faster but the smoke clouds after shooting your cannons is insanely large and youre a sitting duck because you cant tell whats happening, EXPLORATION: AC 3 was fantastic with the forest exploration aspect, and AC 4 was OK at island exploration because it felt too sparse but the islands were either big enough to spend hours on or small enough to spend minutes on, so it was the perfect balance. AC 4 had a large map with several main large Islands with a few docking areas, AC 3 had a few areas that were densely populated with things to do and collect I would describe the exploration of AC 3 as ""rewarding, relaxing, and regular"" and AC 4 as ""decent destination, beautiful exploration, amazing transportation""  Rogue has 3 massive areas to explore all crammed with medium sized areas to explore that are cram-packed with collectibles, and making your way from one small docking area to the next felt like a linear path because you have to maneuver around large islands that you cant dock at.  I would describe Rogue's exploration as ""A clusterf*** of meaningless collectibles and repetitive obstacles"" The Collectibles of AC R is probably the worst part of Rogue's gameplay, not because there's so many types of collectibles, or parts to each collectible, or they're all so widespread. It's because the rewards are worth it. 100% completing this game seems more of a chore to get rewards than an experience to be rewarded for playing. One last thing, that's pretty petty on Ubisoft's part, was the main outfit of the game. You have a slightly different outfit in the mid section of the game, the same coat but missing the red under-jacket part. I assumed that you would automatically be given it during the game's story, but never got it. I completed the game with the ""interim"" outfit. It wasn't until after I beat the game that I found the Templar outfit in the shops. Why wouldn't they tell you that you unlocked the outfit, or automatically equip it when it's unlocked?  But the MOST confusing thing about this game is the false advertising of the hood. Shay Cormac does not have a hood in the game. In all the promotion videos and pictures, Shay is shown with a hood. The staple of the assassin's creed franchise. I hope whoever made the decision to tease us with a hood got fired.",0,0,en

"That Dragon, Cancer firstly is not a game, but an 'experience', having few instances with game mechanics, neither of which requires success to advance. Mostly one simply clicks on obvious clickable objects and watches plot unfurl. This is not a deal breaker for me, as I can move past game mechanics to story.  With a story though, the expectation is of a good story. This game fails to deliver in that regard, emotional on the surface, but not eliciting that emotion. This failure is in many ways muddled by the nature of the subject matter, childhood cancer, which makes me want to instinctively like it because to not feels like an endorsement of cancer and an attack on the people who made this who experienced a definitively tragic event. However, this is another big problem in the creation of the story. This game was created by people with first hand experience in this regard, but they are also the characters in the game, and they have most clearly written themselves into the game in their best Sunday dress. As a result the game is something of a story retold by the people who experienced it, but viewed through their own distorted views of themselves. No one in this game has any sort of flaw whatsoever, and the closest attempts for the characters to have flaws are laughable, amounting to being despondent in a situation where there is no fault feeling as such. The whitewashing crushes the authenticity that could've existed, had this not been a memoir. The entirety of the narration lacked a human feel to it, and made me feel all the worse for not connecting to them as the main character is a cancer patient. Another issue is that one of the central arcs of this game is of Christian responses to crisis. I am not religious, nor am I vehement against it. It feels as though I should at least not be against the theme, because to feel so feels like an aspersion on Christianity, but the theme was poorly thought out and written.  Occasionally, the use feels much like a sermon. I don't require characters to forsake their religion, and it is perfectly fine to be a useful coping mechanism, but it fails as a core game mechanic, serving mostly to deflect the very mortal concepts that would be the story's potential strength. It is alienating, and nothing inspiring came from it. The artistic feel of the game is bland, and much in the game looked like painted wood with occasional real images jarringly inserted into this world. There are no faces in this game, which is understandable as it would be almost impossible to effectively communicate emotion with such faces, but it is symbolic of how this game fails to communicate emotion. The music in the game does not inspire or reinforce the emotions the game is trying to elicit, and is not noteworthy, which given the emotional nature of the game and that music can elicit, is a shame. In the end my emotional response to this game was feeling bad that I didn't feel something from this game, but feeling like I shouldn't criticize it because of what it is. That is not indicative of a quality experience, and at a hefty price tag (15$ as of this writing), that is a very difficult sell, as this game is also quite short. If you think that this is perhaps because of some charitable donation from purchasing this game, then I would look harder, because I could find nothing indicating such a donation, which seems an oversight.",0,0,en

"I like the game mechnics, combat, Physics, Graphics and everything in Player vs Environment mode of the game. I was excited about the pvp mode. But after playing it for few times I am not enjoying it at all. The new Archer class is really  very hard to use in fast paced  pvp gameplay which makes the class no pick for all matches. Only new player takes it who doesn’t know it yet.  I wish the pvp mode was slow paced. This fast paced locomotion and shooting gameplay does not suit for PVP VR. It would be way more fun if the pvp was  slow paced  and tactical teamplay. I would rate the game 7/10 just cause of PVP.  I would not recooment the game for PVP !",0,1,en

"Amazing music but a missed opportunity.      The controls and mechanics of this game are just horrible. I could really get into just driving if it worked well but it feels like somebody's first attempt at making a game. The music is fantastic and I'd recommend getting the soundtrack, but the gameplay is just not fun. The visuals need work too but they're passable. This would be such a nice game to just drive and relax to if the controls weren't frustrating. It is very hard to get the mechanics right in a racing / driving game, and they missed the mark by a lot. You don't get a very good sense of speed. The car just kinda stops when you hit an obstacle. There is no feedback from the driving so you are really aware you're playing somebody's early attempt at a video game. If they could get the driving mechanics down and make it a smooth, easy to play game, then their goal of an aesthetic experience would have been reached. Instead, you just get great music and a game you don't even want to try to play because it is so frustrating an unnatural. I applaud the effort and wish they had more time and talent behind the game mechanics, but this cannot be recommend as a game. Just get the music.",0,0,en

"I am writing this review straight after I finished the game because I can not, for the life in me, let anyone else touch this piece of crap without heeding them that this game is a  t o t a l  mess. As a quick introduction, under no circumstance should you buy it unless you are a masochist or have too much time or money on your hands and want to buy this instead of throwing it in the trash. Spoiler alert: throwing your money in the trash is better than buying this. I got the game for free at a giveaway and I still feel robbed.  Ok then, now that I could express these feelings, it is time to get into the actual review, the part where I explain objectively why it is a bad game. So, Styx is a century-old goblin assassin and thief who takes a job that turns up getting him involved in a hot mess regarding elves, dwarves and amber. Amber is a substance that he uses to fuel his powers like invisibility and cloning, presented as a sort of drug due to the addiction it gives its users. I don't want to spoil the story but I will say that it is awfully mediocre. The classic fantasy tropes are used without much imaginative change. The only thing that was alright was the idea of a goblin plague and of an organization named C.A.R.N.A.G.E that trained humans and dwarves alike to become goblin-killers. The side characters are bland and unmemorable, and because I do not want to repeat myself in the sections to come:  . When is comes to Styx, the protagonist, things get cringe worthy. He has a humor that I can describe only as trying to copy DeadPool but missing every fun aspect. Since every time you die he appears in the game over screen and starts talking to you, apparently the developers believe that breaking the 4th wall in any chance they get is exciting, amazes the audience and makes them laugh their asses off. I have absolutely not rolled my eyes every time he came to my screen with a line like ""Is that your controller in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me?"" or ""I'll have you know that the jump button is not between your ass cheeks!"". Sarcasm aside, his jokes are anything but funny to anyone that's past 12 years old. Because he has a different line depending on the cause of your game over, if the lines were actually well written, it would have been quite an interesting element. It can be seen from a mile away that he is an utterly failed attempt at a bombastic, badass and comical character that would have stolen people's hearts. The only thing that was not that bad about Styx was his voice acting. I must say, the tutorial level really had me liking the mechanics, albeit them being the classic stealth gameplay with little twists here and there. It actually seemed like a game with a lot of potential. Sure, there were some bugs here and there, but it would get better (that is the lie I have told myself over and over until mission 6 when I would have quit if I weren't so far into the game). You have your everyday crouch, detection bars, floors that make quieter or louder sounds, stealth kills, invisibility power, a skill tree, a crafting table, etc. (none of them out of the ordinary stuff you usually find in a stealth game). Stealth kills were somewhat impressing since they are split into two: tap the button to perform a kill that is faster but the nearby enemies will hear you, or hold the button for a slower kill, but you muffle the enemy while doing it. Kind of like in Hitman where you can snap someone's neck with the fiber wire or just choke them to unconsciousness with it, except in this game you have literally 0 methods that are non-lethal, and the funny thing is you even have a medal in every mission for not killing anyone, but that didn't bother me since I saw it as a welcome challenge.  Well, it would have been a welcome challenge if the rest of the mechanics were actually well implemented. Good idea, poor execution. The thing that stands out the most for me, since I always tried taking the high routes, is the ""parkour"" mechanics, which are devastatingly clunky and horrifyingly buggy. 90% of the times I ended up dying because Styx would just randomly decide to woosh off a ledge, drop without grabbing anything or fall through/next to the ledge I was trying to grab next. Since the jumps don't auto-lock to the closest thing near you that you can jump on, it ends up giving off the feeling of a 3D platformer that was never meant to be a 3D platformer, and so players trying to take any route involving the low way or the high way are automatiaclly discouraged. The A.I is quite unbalanced due to the bugs it is experiencing. One mission the enemies will have no clue you are there if you are standing 10 meters in front of them in a fully lit hallway, and another mission the same type of enemy will look towards you when you throw a distraction item instead of where the item was thrown, instantly blowing your cover (no, that is not a feature, I know some stealth game A.I does that on purpose but here it's not the case). And the same type of enemy will see you if you are 20 meters away from them, on a rooftop in broad daylight, just by looking in your general direction. Since the game has a smell mechanic (you can see the smell trail left by enemies if you activate your amber vision) and dwarves are the only enemies that can smell your presence, that is the only challenge I have found in the otherwise dumb enemies. Checkpoints. Checkpoints are at fault for 80% of this game's problems. Of course other issues wouldn't be so evident if you had a different checkpoint system, but when the last auto-save pulls you back 30 minutes across the level, you start noticing the things I mentioned above as well.  Let me explain. There are 2 situations of checkpoints I have found in this game, where you can't manual save mid-level: a) A checkpoint every 2 or 3 objectives: you are in a city of goblin hunters with enemies that insta-kill you if they catch you. You have to find 3 bombs. You find a warehouse with the first bomb. . You have to follow footprints. You get to the source of the footprints (note that they take you through half the map of the level). You have to follow the another set that stems from the source. You find a warehouse with a closed gate to the second bomb. A locked door guarded by a dwarf is the only point of entry. Let's say you try something, he detects you, and you die here. Look back to when the game last saved. It took you a good 15 minutes (or more depending on your playstyle) to follow those footsteps and get to the second bomb, and now you're back there. Fail 2 more times and roughly 45 minutes of your day are down the drain due to horrible game design. b) 2 checkpoints... on the same objective? : ""Saved successfully"" will sometimes appear in the corner of your screen two times after a random objective that was usually easy to get to. Maybe it is a visual bug. Also, the level design is sometimes good, but ""good"" is the maximum it reaches. There are 2 boss fights as well, with the last one being there just for the sake of making the game longer. I won't talk about the graphics since they are not relevant by the time of this review and you're probably not playing it for its beauty anyway. All the bad elements combined make this game a definite no-go. The bugs, the horrible controls, the mediocre story, the bland characters, the humor that is trying too hard and the simple, unimpressive dialogue make this game shine by absolutely nothing. It gets really frustrating at times, albeit being quite short, and doesn't really give you any reason to buy it except if you are a fan of Styx because you played the previous games.",0,0,en
"In it's current state I cannot recommend this game. It's got a huge amount of potential considering the skateboarding video game scene, but that's all it has. This seems like a demo of a bigger game, but isn't.

"First off, the game is actually pretty fun. Though I mostly played on the non-steam version and have a lot more hours than just what is shown. In any case. As someone who doesn't like PvP at all, in BDO its probably the most ""carebear"" PvP I've ever seen in a PvP MMO. So much so that as a PVEr it doesn't bother me at all. For one, dying in pvp gives you no penalties at all. If you die in PVE you lose EXP, so dying in PVE is actually vastly worse. And the game has a TON of PVE content, housing, crafting, worker empire building and all kinds of stuff. The housing system is actually really great and one of the better ones. Its definitely more than just grinding mobs 24/7. The problem is the community that plays this game. Political bot spam (and sure political trolls and bots in all MMOs even WoW, but in BDO its a ton worse), trolls in general, people that pretend to be pedophiles (or maybe they aren't pretending which is scary) and the community is just generally one of the worst. Its definitely not the worst community I've seen in an MMO, but its definitely up there.  And when one plays an MMO, its generally for the community and other people that play it, and who wants to play an MMO with such a terrible community unless they are also terrible?",0,0,en

"What could've been some ""minecraft modpack standalone kinda game"" with farming, building, processing ressources, turned out to be a pathetic update lacking, ""bad russian dev"" stereotype kinda game.  Updates just aren't updates. Just look at the ducking patch notes (for real just look) and feel how professionally this game was made (sarcasm) .  They don't care, they're just in for the $$. Devs don't even answer poor guys in the forum or not accurately, because guess what, their english is worst than mine. (I'm french for god's sake) This game kinda pissed me off, cuz i'm a simple survival game player, i don't need outsanding content on day one, i understrand what early access is all about, i need a stable solid base (Which the game kinda had on day one).  Empyrion did that for example. Unturned did that > For those saying that this may be some one man dev and that he may have a hard time.  I liked the game on day one. But it ducking hasn't changed at all. It's still the same ducking experience you do. Having fun with 15 machines growing ducking bananas and you're done, no automation, no ♥♥♥♥. Nothing whatsoever. Sure building is fun, go ducking buy minecraft okay?  If there's one thing i hate it's when devs actually don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about people that enjoy their game. ""IllusoryWorldEntertainment"" Yeah, that's all in the name, Illusory updates, illusory bugfixes, illusory changes. It's all a ducking troll. This game shouldn't have ""Mostly Positive"" reviews, it should get a ton of sh*t in the face, because when these guys are actually getting unnoticed, some people actually struggle to make a game and are getting ♥♥♥♥ reviews.  This shouldn't exist, this shouldn't be, Steam shouldn't let such guys sell products they don't even update. I mean sure it's 10$ or 6$ on sale, but after a year of developpement we're pretty much on day one developpement stage. Shame on them. So please everyone, don't buy this game, don't rate it positively, just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ until some update that's actually greater than 10mb comes out, with real content and not ducked up glitched content, where you get (rather try to get) to a dungeon and fall through the world and then your whole world is ducked and feels like you're in another dimension.  I liked this game, i hoped it would've updated nicely even if it's kinda slow, i wouldn't have cared. I even thought to myself (on day one) that even if it looked a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥, i'm sure they'll get new mechanics in, new machines, planets, stuff to actually DO in the game without it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glitching on you. But guess what, if i'm writing this today, you can understand all that didn't happen. So please, just let StarsOne die.  It's never gonna become anything, do not hope. The game is still a ""fun"" way to kill time if you don't pay for it, but yeah, you'll get 10-30 hours of gameplay like me and then you'll see how empty it is, and that the game never really changed in any way.  Even with a multiplayer it would be empty since there's nothing to do besides farming and bulding, so if you want to build a map sized castle with a chest full of every type of ressources and 10km of banana trees then feel free to do it, but man, there's gotta be other games to do that same ♥♥♥♥ that are actually good.

"Wasteland Workshop is the Horse Armor of Fallout 4, It's not ""as bad"" as Horse Armor, but it's the complete opposite of what Horse Armor was trying to achieve: ""Seeing what people were willing to play"" And in this case, It has a mostly negative reviewed dlc from various websites, and plenty of negative feedback, yet, bethesda decided it would be great to release 2 more after the kind of negative community posts they received and all the negative reviews on this dlc's store page, which also makes me think they planned this dlc well ahead of time. But there's a second part to the horse armor's point: ""Checking what dlc their fanbase wanted to see"" This DLC fails to appeal to the majority of fallout 4's fanbase, so it fails on both points, and the only reason why a lot of people own this dlc package is because of the pre-order season pass, and the november 10th and on season pass.

"I have bought this game in a bundle. Well, I am glad I did, because I didn't really like it. Let me explain you why. At the beginning, there was this game called GRADIUS by Konami. Konami thought ""Let's make a parody of it!"" and made created one of the best gaming series ever: PARODIUS! Memories! I remember playing that game on the SNES and on the very first Playstation console. Yes, THIS game is similar to Parodius. Oh, I wish there was an original Parodius port on Steam available! Unfortunately, there is none. And this game failed me...and I will tell you a few lines later why. Remember the humour the Parodius series had to offer? Well, I do. Vegetables, natural food, goofy bosses and angry animals are trying to kill you this time and you have to dodge them and/or their bullets, hearts or whatever they are shooting at you. I must say the creators did a good job with the character and level designs. Everything is colorful and humorous. Now you might think ""wait a minute, seems you like it! Why the thumbs down then?"" K, here is the answer: The controls are the reason! I started the game after a couple of issues (I will explain that a few lines later), and pushed the down-key after the 1st level started. I don't know if you know this Arcade game called Tapper's, where you move up and down and switch to fixed positions. It felt like my character in this game moved down and stopped at certain position where I thought there are some kind of ""lanes"" and you move your character up and down to swtich between these. No, the thing was, there weren't any fixed positions, you can move your character by keeping the direction keys pushed. Guess what: You can't tell if your character will stop moving after you release the direction key. It might still be moving a little bit more, or stop immediately. Well, imagine you release the direction key and your character keeps moving to the same direction before it finally stopss...at the wrong position where it catches an enemy bullet! This happened to me. And then, there is this thing with the control settings in the main menu. Right after I started the game, I didn't know which key I had to push to enter the selected menu. Rushing over all key on my keyboard, I made it to the keyboard settings menu. It didn't show you any list of the keys, but instead it asked me to choose which key shall be used for what (left, right, up, down, attack, super-attack, pause). First it asked me """", then ""Press a key for right"", etc... Oh, that """" I just mentioned is true, the words ""Press a key for up"" are missing, so I saw no text instead. Right, did I forget to mention anything? I guess not. If they can fix the controls, it'd be great. But with these broken controls, it's not fun.",0,0,en

I mean the game have recoil patterns & familiar hit-damage to Counter strike which means the game highly rewards skill. but the Nades are kinda bound to luck when they are super lethal.

Movements & specially Shooting animation arent smooth & look clunky Competitive gaming it doesnt have voice chat, & on top of that you cannot chat with teammates while dead. at the moment it doesnt have ranked match making. Some items you purchase are temporary, kind of stupid ( Grenades huh) & a smarter move would be the purchase of weapon gadgets (permanant) that arent customizable while they should be. i like the game & it has more great potential, but since my main problem (written above ) is probably a core aspect to this game & will not be changed, i wouldnt recommand the game, how ever i might still play it just because it feels like counter strike & the glorious sound when u get a kill ree",0,1,en

"The combat in this game is neat, but it is entirely designed for one on one combat. However, for some inexplicable reason, this game has been littered with 1v2-3-4 and so on battles around every turn, and it does not play well. Maybe there's options for it somewhere in the menus, but this game's lock on system are unfathomably clunky.  You lock on by tapping the right bumper on controller. To even think about changing targets, you need to hold down that right bumper to enable your right stick to change targets, as they have mechanics already bound to the right stick, like parries. With other games, the lock on system is just a simply click of the stick, and you flick it to change targets. Super easy, super natural. Adding that extra button that needs to be held breaks muscle memory and ruins your flow in an instant. In situations where there are more than two enemies (or just two if they're particularly strong and aggressive) this title is almost unplayable. and it's almost the ENTIRETY of the challenges the game throws your way. Playing with friends would be an upside, but once you get to any actual challenges the game forces you into solo. Maybe things changed with the new expansion, but early game for this title requires true patience. Obviously, these could just be solved by putting in more time and learning to master the systems. If you chose to do this, I would imagine it would take far longer than other games would, based on how 1v1 central the combat is. Maybe one day I'll turn to this game and get really into it, then have to change this review because my third eye opened to how this game really works. For now though, I wanted to have a fun little casual experience with my friends, and there is nothing casual about this title unfortunately. It's just frustrating, and it seems confused on how it should handle enemy encounters, or even control. No discredit to those who chose to stick with this game. You have all of my respect for pushing through and prevailing over these messy systems.",0,0,en

"Would only recommend for $4 or less, one of the worst experiences on a full fledged VR game that wasn't just a port. - Stabbing and impaling is very fun. - One or two game mechanics that add to immersion, although unfortunately there's no real in game scenario you'd ever be in to need or even want to go out of your way to use (i.e, climbing with an axe). - 90% of combat feels terrible and clunky. - Impaling enemies feels like the only thing that does any damage, slashing feels horrible. - In game, your arms don't move as fast as they do in real life. - Incredibly repetitive. - Only four maps, none of which have any real change other than ""hey, look, these enemies have a different outfit and slightly different weapons"" (as if it mattered, the AI is all exactly the same and I'm sure it can't tell the difference) - The game tries to incorporate ""mana"" usage and has the fact that you can use spells as a selling point, despite the fact that there are only two. Lightning strike, which does absolutely nothing, and a slow motion mechanic (which is pretty entertaining, but only lasts about 3 seconds without going into the debug menu to change it) Here we go. - The controls change. Constantly. The developers went from a semi-competent and user friendly button layout to one that's infuriating and impossible to figure out without going to the forums for help. - There is a single locomotion option. You can change the direction you move from your head (my god, the only thing in VR that has ever made me motion sick.) to your hand, which is still pretty terrible but certainly better than the default option they have you in. - You cannot change their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ button layout. To change any settings at all, you need to open the settings book. This used to mean you'd just press a menu button. Now it means you have to ""click in the inner right radius of the right trackpad and the left menu button at the same time"" if you're on Vive. Have fun spinning to the right for a solid three minutes. - Over priced. - Unoptimized. TL;DR - Just buy Gorn. You'll have a better experience and get more time out of it.",0,1,en
"Seems Valve's marketing tricks are working nicely on me, because I was using this steam labs  which suggested me a list of games. And guess which game was among the results? Anyway, I gave this a try because it was on sale. You run around and shoot an army of skeletons, zombies and demons with their sailors peeking out. And no, there is no rocket launcher in this game, just a shotgun, a railgun and a melee weapon. It's just a kinky clone of Painkiller, with the difference that you're not a guy who wants to save his soul or the one of his loved one. You're a kinkily dressed woman in pink, okay? Everytime you kill an enemy they leave some kinky toy behind. Talking about behind, I don't wanna know how these toys got in their bodies but I really would like to know how these female models that show up every now and then got in them. Our heroine seems to have done everything before, because she doesn't seem to have any issues picking those items up. Doesn't surprise me much. There are so many items to pick up, like handcuffs and a lot of long items for insertion purposes. Kind of educational, because if you had no clue yet, at least at that point you will learn what an ultra-feminist is spending her hard-earned cash on. We have to show respect, okay? Because of the wage-gap they can't afford them all. Instead they are forced to blame us men for everything wrong in this world. And they gonna hate me for this review...or because I played this game...or just because of me being a cis-gendered man...or they gonna blame me for the existence of this game...or because I dislike it, since it represents women-power... The reason I dislike this game is, that you have to pick one of three areas and run in circle all the time. Run, shoot and pick all the items and ammo up. At the same area. All the time until you get pwnd. Not much fun.",0,0,en

"Where do I even start with this game, oh yeah! I did not pay 60$ for Arma 4! Rockstar has had a long streak with me and my gaming experience and nearly every one of their games has been an absolute slapper, and GTA was lined up to be their next baby. And so it was the grand release of GTA5 drops and the story mode was amazing, literally A1. But then dive in to GTA online, we start to see a different side to this game, a game based on cops and robbers becomes a military simulator, a toxic battle field of sweaty tryhard on flying rocket shooting bikes, aimbotting cops in missions and rogue traffic out for your head. And I wish I could blame this on the players but rockstar continues to promote this behaviour like adding orbital cannons so that way you can spend mommies credit card to get some online salt.

"I played a bunch of the beta, so now that the full game is released I feel I can write my first review of the game. Fall Guys is SO CLOSE to being really good, but there's just a few things in the game that need to be changed to let me get consistent enjoyment out of it. The positives of the game is that it's goofy fun, and easy to jump into a game. Other people's reviews will cover the fun parts of the game, but I wanted to highlight the things that stop me from giving this game a positive review. 1) Team games need to get in the bin. They're the least fun part of Fall Guys, as you can get knocked out from a show even by playing really well. There's very little feedback from the game as to what is happening across the rest of the match. When you lose it wasn't down to your fault, and when you win it doesn't feel satisfying. There needs to be separate playlists for solo play and team play, and the team games need to be adjusted so that you'll be playing with the same team for the whole show and you can actually feel like you're contributing to a team effort. There would need to be ways to communicate with your team similar to rocket league, or by using the otherwise pointless emote system. 2) The costume colours need to get in the bin. It feels really scummy that not only do you need to wait for the store to refresh an item you're looking for (the store is ripped directly from fortnite) but you have to buy multiple costumes to have choices of colours. The costumes even change colours for team games, so there should definitely be a way for the player to customise the colour of the costumes they've unlocked. The player colours that you unlock end up feeling a bit worthless when wearing a costume has the possibility of completely obscuring it anyway. Why is it that the design decision was made for a player to either prioritise a player skin/colour or a costume? It's really peculiar and only seems to be used to pad out the amount of content in the store. 3) Lack of content. I read somewhere that there are 25 different maps at launch, with some maps sharing the same game mode. The most fun parts of the game are the obstacle courses, and there reaaaaaally needs to be more, preferably with the option of a playlist of only obstacle courses. The maps are all made from the same building blocks, so it shouldn't be too difficult to have a bunch more of them in the game. Considering the game isn't free to play, and this isn't early access, I hope that the roster of maps will be updated very soon and not at the end of season 1 which is going to go on for 60 days... 4) Some of the game modes are really not that fun at all. It's usually the team ones, but especially game modes like the Jinxed one. In Jinxed, two teams are pitted against each other and you have to grab players to infect them. Last team with an uninfected player wins. No matter how the game is played it pretty much always comes down to 1 player left on each team, and you'll likely have very little involvement with how the match ends up finishing. I'm sure on paper team games looked like fun, but seeing as this game is ""heavily inspired"" by Takeshi's Castle, it's worth looking at why they didn't really do team games. I hope that now the game is out, feedback from players will help shape what game modes get further development and which game modes get more maps. 5) £50/$60 currency purchase in the store. I mean, what more needs to be said about that. The game isn't free so you can't just carbon copy the store from fortnite, which is a free to play game. I don't like paying for and playing a game that essentially tells me I'm wasting my time earning currency by actually playing it, when I could instead make a purchase of 100K coins that would take me dozens of hours to grind out. I'm honestly okay with paying £4/$5 for 3 exclusive skins as DLC, as is currently on offer, but the in-game store purchases are just really not nice for the players. This game is so close to being really, really good, and I hope that the developer's response to community feedback will shape the game and let me change this review to a positive one in the future.",0,0,en
"The DayZ journey - How to waste years of developement for nothing After years of being in alpha- and beta-state of development the game is now released...and it still looks like an indie title which was released yesterday after getting kickstarted. The graphics are far from looking good, the surroundings are looking cheap and repetitive and the poor background sounds are only interrupted by a few zombie moans. There are still many bugs and the gameplay is an neverending journey of searching for food and drinks (which you often don't find and you die with your full equipment somewhere in the nowhere). I bought the game years ago when they said ""We develop a great game which is gonna be awesome when its fully released - buy it now!"" I bought it - I played it - And now I am incredibly disappointed.  They released a boring, still beta, game which suffers through insane long and tormenting foodhunts and monotony in gameplay and environment. Great potential totally wasted.",0,0,en

"I found it difficult to suggest whether to recommend this game or not as I do have mixed feelings towards D4. Firstly the concept of the game shows real promise, a detective with the ability to dive into the past using momentos in search for his wife's killer and the same person who shot him in the head effectively erasing his memory. The QTE's were one of the enjoyable aspects of the game and interactions with the environment. The voice acting is good except for one or two characters in perticular a giant man in a medical suit and mask called Roland Walker whom speaks unnecessarily slow, so slow infact that I just have to skip his diaologue as it just frustrates me how long it takes for him to string a sentence together. The worse part I'd have to say though would be how abruptly season one ended, it consists of 3 episodes, the prologue, episode 1 and episode 2, the prologue was good and easily explained what was going on, episode 1 had some action scenes and got interesting then episode 2 consisted of walking down corridor to one end to the other solving 2 easy puzzles then ending when it started to get good. Personally I'd wait for the season two release before buying into season one. ****UPDATE 05.01.17**** So it seems season 2 of this game has been cancelled so therefore I'm changing my previous recommended review to a not recommended review. As I stated above in my previous review which was wrote almost over a year and a half ago (June 2015) this game showed real promise, the story and the characters were interesting, but what we've been left with is an unfinushed game, half a game if you will...  Personally I find it out of order that Hidetaka Suehiro would just turn around after a year and a half absence and say that he's retired from Access Games despite his health being perfectly fine, and leaving his work unfinised. Too many game developers take us (the consumers) for a ride and it's unacceptbale, it's also becomming a reoccurring thing as well. The only saving grace is if Access Games get the go ahead to develop a second season, but personally I think it's dead now and probably not worth Access Games time or money. Anyway I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you like undeveloped and unfinished games. 6/10",0,0,en

"I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :D Pastry 2 cups all-purpose flour  1 teaspoon salt  2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening  4 to 6 tablespoons cold water  Filling 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar  1/4 cup all-purpose flour  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  1/8 teaspoon salt  8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)  2 tablespoons butter or margarine  1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary). 2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling. 3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side. 4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate. 5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning. 6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking.

"I don't think this is a good Wolfenstein game, the game has a few things that ruin the game for me and make my will to play it lower significantly, one would be that the feeling the other games have is missing here, another would be that while the other games had bullet sponges the ones in this don't feel difficult to kill they just feel like a drag to kill as they are not hard to kill they just take a while to whittle them down, there are a bunch of other thing that ruin it for me one would be the ""co-op/AI"" as I prefer playing campaigns in Singleplayer and the AI gets annoying, there are a bunch of other small things I dislike too but they are basically nitpicks.

"First things first, Unity 3D. Who thought this was going to on the Unity 3D engine? Anyone? Nope. Why is it on the Unity 3D engine? Who knows. Whoever made that decision is the reason why this game has such horrific reviews. The animations, Frame Rates and over all clunky feeling the ENTIRE game has is most likely due to the engine being Unity 3D. Watch as you get a solid maybe 70 frames, then your sensitivity will skyrocket as your FPS dips to like 20 and it picks it back up. I ran this game in 1440p, on the lowest settings with a 2080TI and the entire time the game is open your GPU will be hard stuck at 99% usage the entire time this game is open.  Thats the Unity 3D engine for ya. Second stop on this ride is the Animations. A disaster in itself. NONE of the animations I saw ran smoothly/correctly. Many times your gun (Especially the magnum) will clip back to the last frame of the shooting animation, so it just jitters back and forth sometimes. The enemy movement is choppy, and whenever you kill anyone they all to the SAME EXACT death animation every single time. Think of a T pose, but with them holding a finger pistol and then just toppling over. On every single enemy. Completely ruins the immersion every time you kill someone. In a nutshell this is how animations are -   : 3 minutes of just WTF. Basically in the entire game Graphical wise - I didn't see many issues. It looked good when standing still, hence why the screenshots make the game look amazing on the store page.  AI in this game is also just a mess. I played on the second to last hardest difficulty. So basically hard, and in-between trying to aim correctly with the   and messed up animation you can basically just click once on their head and their dead. I barely ever even checked my health unless I was getting sniped, without the snipers and bazookas the damage input to you is next to nothing. I played up until the mission where you go into the tent to bug the guys office. No matter what I did, I always failed the mission as soon as I planted the bug. I hid bodies, did everything but as soon as the guy spawns in it was game over. After 2 tries at that, I gave up and started writing the review. In a nutshell, I do not see many of these issues getting fixed with the current engine and I do not ever see this game going above ""Mixed"" reviews on steam. Why they thought this was ready to roll out as a completed game is beyond me and is now on my list for THE worst remake I have ever played. For a full playthrough of what I painstakingly went through, you can watch the stream and click anywhere in the video to see this game in its full, depressing glory. By about minute 10 I realized I was in for a treat, and now cannot refund due to steams 2 hours rule.

"Well where do I start, i suppose the main point is at this point in time this game seems like a half finished beta currently. Yes it looks good and to some extent is fun though I wouldn't purchase it at this current point in time for those that have not done so. This game requires some major bug fixes and performance/AI/network improvement patches which is understandable but it seriously feels lackluster in terms of content. Why they didn't just have singleplayer coop and decided to add a seperate multiplayer mode that is an even less fleshed out version of the single player I have no idea, feels like a waste of resources there. Weapons that are supposed to be part of the game have been removed from multiplayer due to balancing and performance (Flamethrower). Some of theweapons feel like they have no oomph eg the plasma connon I belive should gib a bunch of the genestealers not just one, seems like the damage is distibuted between them instead of a damage spere of effect depending how close the projectile is shot away from the targets. Autocannons have some insane amount of accuracy issue and as a terminatior is basically a moving firing platform i belive this needs to be toned down at least when standing still. All in all im disappointed with the state this was released in and belive the devlopers needed more time to flesh out the game and bug/performance fix and as a purley speculative thought i think they have been rushed to release by the publisher. It's a shame that this game which so many 40k fans were looking forward to and have spent their cash on is in this state and is a further lesson to wait for reviews and not preorder. I do hope the developer can fix this game and support it to get to a state that keeps it alive and wish them luck but I doubt ill be touching this too much until then.",0,0,en

"Saw a free to play TD game in the Steam Store and decided, sure why not, it's free to play and in the Alpha, what harm could it do to give it a try? After playing through essentially all of the content the alpha had to offer in a matter of 30 minutes, I had come to several conclusions about the game. I'll go ahead and make a pro/con list like several others may have done. Pros: - It has potential - Relatively appealing graphics - A decent amount of strategy required to 3-star the levels and get all of the gems from them Cons: (can also be seen as a list of things to add/work on, almost like constructive criticism) - Hovering over the spells in levels, you'll find that they entirely lack a description - The plot for the game should not be just a button you can click at the title screen and read through a wall of text for any information as to what is going on in this world and what your purpose is for fighting these creatures. A good idea that many similar games have used is having a mascot-like character that assists and is almost like your partner (except they only appear as a still image and have text box pop-ups that help explain the story throughout your first part of the game) - Having the scenery look nice is lovely but it also feels a tad bit cluttered at times, perhaps tone it down a notch - At the start it not made clear as to whether or not you are attempting to build and defend your town or if you go out on missions to other places (the player is given the idea that perhaps the levels are just waves of opponents being thrown at their town) - The entire town and all of the buildings that exist in it seem to have no purpose whatsoever as of right now, they have no description and there is no way to interact with anything there. The only thing that building accomplishes is leveling up your town level, but as it turns out upping your town level doesn't do anything yet either. Or if it does it's not made clear what it does - There was no music (not sure if this was some sort of error on my part but everything seemed to be working just fine for me) and the sounds became repetitive and boring quickly, this is definitely something that can be expanded upon and improved, the example given in the video for the game sounds better than what is actually put out in the game as of this moment - Since there is only 3 levels you have access to and can 3 star you have a very finite amount of gems when compared to the large number of things/upgrades or spells you can spend your gems on, makes it so you have to choose very few things and probably don't get to experience some or many parts of the upgrade and spell system in one play through of the current Alpha - Towers, placing them, and upgrading them all feel a little rigid and/or janky and could use some smoothing out to make placing or upgrading that tower you need to clutch it out and kill the last guy before he makes it through a little bit easier. - The option to zoom out even more so that you can view the entire map at once would be much appreciated, makes you feel like you have more control of the situation and can help areas in critical need more swiftly and adeptly. For now, I can't really say that I had fun in the 30 minutes I played so I'm going to give it a negative review, there is a lot that could be done on top of the things I've mentioned to improve this game and I understand that it's only the Alpha. It makes me excited to see what it might become if they keep working on it. I encourage the developer to improve the game so I can change my rating to positive! ;)",0,0,en

"I decided to edit my meme review into something more appropriate so people would take it seriously and get a proper warning on the state of the game at the moment so they don't cry later on when Steam doesn't accept their refund request. So first and foremost, no, I am not refunding the game. I bought it at a cheap and ignorable price few years ago back when it was in early alpha stage. My hours and reason don't matter because of how old this purchase is.  This has been my biggest ""WTF"" launch experience (yet) on all games I've backed during EA phase. The servers have spent more time being offline than online since launch and that's the biggest red flag. Take note however that the game is still playable offline but characters from online and offline could not be transferred so if you decide to play with a friend or do some trading in the future there is no point in creating a character offline.  They keep issuing maintenance without notice and people who aren't on subreddit or discord have no clue on what's happening. What's more, they do not even follow the ETA (if there is one) they keep posting and you could be sure there will be another maintenance following within few hours after the servers got back up. Not to mention the server did a 2 day rollback immediately when the server crashed causing people who invested a lot of hours on those 2 days to lose their progress. To even further the absurdity of this release, A LOT of people experience glitch from losing items in their stash and inventory to losing their actual characters.  Some people get stuck with game breaking bugs such as being fast-forwarded in the questline (mobs being way too hard and becomes unfinishable), falling/teleporting to places where they can't get out of. Economy in the game is screwed too. They released a game with a very easy and known exploit knowing it will be obviously abused (or try) by a lot of people then decide to punish people who do it. I could go on and on on what's wrong with the game but if you just lurk in any of the Wolcen communities the game has become a huge meme and I wouldn't recommend it at this point. If you are looking to just know the story and see what the game has to offer maybe I would recommend it and play offline. But if you are looking to casually or competitively play an ARPG, involve yourself with the community. This is a bad time to jump in the game. Give it a couple more of months.",0,0,en

"Blatant lies from Devs saying the problems in Chivalry would not be present in this game. ""High Skill"" Duels are nothing but broken animation users who abuse the 240 system with swing binds. It makes the 240 system completely useless as they can just look wherever they please with no repercussion on how the swing is suppose to be taken with the original attack. Removal of the swing binds would greatly balance the game and remove a lot of the broken moves that are actually exploits in the animation mechanics. Server browser is completely broken only shows a handful (if any at all) of servers and nothing I've done regarding changing settings via In-game and steams ping settings has fixed it. There are far too many exploits being abused and closet cheaters using swing/parry recovery cheats and auto blockers. The Devs have done nothing to address the actual problems with this game in regards to combat. Everything you could do in Chiv you can still perform in some way in Mordhau and it's absolutely disgraceful.

"I literally wouldn't play this game if it was free, and neither should you. To be clear, I've had PlanetBase on my ""I'll buy it if it goes on sale"" wishlist for a while, but a friend decided to gift it to me because it was on sale. I was hesitant, because of repeated and noteworthy condemnations of the AI in Planetbase, but I gave it a go anyway. PlanetBase is just... Baad. The tutorial, for instance, is the exact opposite of productive, because it gives the player a very false impression of the timescales they have to work in. In fact, day and night cycle quickly, and needs like oxygen tick down quite rapidly, requiring that they be serviced immediately; in effect, when beginning, there is a jump order in which things must be built, else your colony fails. The tutorial, on the other hand, gives the impression that you have tons of time. That, combined with the repeated, insistent reviews indicating that the AI breaks entirely when your colony starts to get large, the fact that the only building you may place arbitrarily is the very first one following which everything must be connected, the inability to simply adjust camera pitch which proved maddening in play, all combine to make a game I literally would not play if it were free. Save your money, preorder Aven Colony or something. I actually requested a refund to give my friend his money back. I couldn't in good conscience let his money remain spent on something so aggressively subpar.",0,0,en

"game will do fraudulent charges on your account stealing your money double charging you for packages, if you speak to support, it's a common issue and they refuse to do anything about it. Figure I might explain more to warn other people, if buy the monthly card in game, it will setup a monthly subscription on your account in steam and at the renewal time  auto take out the money based on the card. perfect right? sure, then the 2nd day they take out another monthly payment, 3rd day, they take out another payment, you see where this is going.  Lucky I caught this before it took out anymore more by cancelling the sub in steam. The fun part is, all this is non-refundable because in game items are no refund, double charge or not, steam agree'ed they'd never refund it, game company tells you a monthly sub means you'll be charged more than once, so they don't care either plus the policy is also no refunds for in game items. The weird thing is, you get charged all this, OUT of game using steam sub. strange. nothing in game about it. Edit: after steam support 100% refused to read my messages and spending roughly 1-2 weeks going back and forth I was finally able to get a Support member on steam who could read and got my refund on the double purchase, but LIKE i been saying and LIKE what this guy said, they dont normally do refunds for DLC's but BECAUSE this company has a known issues(going back to 2016) that it will double charge your card. Also if you want a refund, you have to get proof that you spoke with warplanet first as steam pretty much tells you to pound sound with my first 8 replies from them. and they will close your ticket without reading your message so dont ever asked them to close the ticket with new info as they'll skip any new info and close the tickket, they'll use that as an excuse not to do their job. ALSO WARNING PRE-authorized amount is a lie, steam will and does over charge that amount and tells you too bad it's non-refundable. Yes thats correct, if a game charges you x4 the amount you set in the pre-authorized, steam WILL/DOES allow any game to by pass this limit. When you questioned them about this, they just give you the useless info page about how subs work, if you reply there is no info on there about steam going above the pre authorized amount, and they'll close your ticket, be safe and dont put too much money on steam as steam and these shady companies work together with policy's and TOS  to steal it and do everything not to give it back.",0,0,en

"Well usually, I fully complete the game, and then I write a detailed review for it, but this time I don’t even feel like doing it.  This remake is the laziest and the most disrespectful product I have ever seen in my life, a true spit in the face of every XIII fan. I was really waiting for this game and I even played the original game a few months ago just to refresh it in my memory and to be able to compare it after all those years. The original game looks so much better than this rip off - that’s all you have to know about this remake.  - If you are familiar with the original game, you should probably remember that the game starts with a comic strips-alike cutscene showing us a short story of what we are dealing with and what is the main story of the game. Well, the developers didn’t even bother too much to recreate it, so they just created a short starting cutscene, where we see the FBI agent, who comes into the room and watches this original comic strip scene on the big screen, absolutely the same as it was back in 2003, no remake at all. That was disgusting, seriously. - The audio in the game appears and disappears all the time for no reason. First, you don’t hear a thing and then you suddenly start hearing background sounds that appear out of nowhere, and then they disappear again. Constant music stuttering and voice acting is so cheap. - Everytime you kill someone, the body drops on the ground with very weird and unworked animation, the whole body turns into some kind of a puppet that dangles on the floor.  - Overall graphics and the overall feeling of the game is very odd and unpleasant - it doesn’t feel like it was remade with love and passion. It’s just lazy work with no great visual enhancements at all. I can not and I would not recommend the game in its current state, I don’t know either this game has been abandoned in the middle of the process or is it just day one issues. But if it’s the way the developers wanted their remake to look like - well, this is really awful.",0,0,en

"It's just mediocre twin stick shooter with crazy amount of enemies and unbalanced gameplay. I bought it hoping for humorous title, but all jokes were already in the trailer. The story is that devil turned everybody into devilish creatures and we have to kill them all. I was kinda expecting some angry rabbits attacking people, maybe  some vandalism on behalf of other creatures or something like this. Nothing like that happens, all of the enemies stand perfectly still and will only attack us when we approach them. It's not that evil in itself, animals are just protecting theirs territory. Hopefully they also have red eyes and sharp teeth so we know for sure that they're posessed. Story aside, gameplay has good ideas and bad execution. We have basic gun attack on LMB and sword attack/bullets deflect on RMB. Deflecting isn't 100% reliable, as this movement always starts from top of our hero and goes to bottom in half-circle motion. That means we just can't instantly deflect bullets coming from below. There are many levels that just go up-down-up-down, and going down is much harder because of this. Worry not, we also have grenades. We have unlimited amount of them, but they're tied to cooldown. What's really irritating is that when you start a level you have to wait 10 seconds before you can use it. What's even more irritating is that the cooldown is set to 10 every time you change a stage, even when entering the hidden rooms. Since our basic attack does little damage you'd like to start your onslaught with a bang, but then you'd have to wait 10 seconds till your skill can be used.  Ok, but now we have even better attack - spell that covers whole screen, that is also tied to a cooldown, but this time it clocks at 60. I'll admit that having last resort panic button with longer timer is reasonable, but many times it would just not work as intended. This attack is RNG whether it hits your targets or not. Many times it wouldn't hit enemies close to me, sometimes it would just bombard away couple of enemies on far end of the screen, leaving large amount of them unscathed.  Last idea that actually work is your companion. You can occasionally find a sidekick that can help you with fights. These can give you some modificators like attacking your enemies, healing you over time or adding effects to your bullets. SIdekicks can be found in chests and these can be found in hidden rooms or somewhere on the level. Hidden rooms are bothering me though. They're small, always have some enemies to kill and sometimes have a trap. There's no variation here, so at the end of the game I'd just skip them entirely to not waste time on them.  Now talking about bad execution, the gameplay itself is pretty bad. My biggest gripe is about how fast our heroes walk. They're always running at full speed and stop with a small delay. You'll be running into traps, enemies and bullets, or you'll be taking the game extra slow, picking enemies from afar and making small steps to not lose your cool. Charging enemies will sometimes force you to retreat and then you'll see how bad the camera and fast movement hate each other. You see, the camera is following the cursor, and that means you'll run into enemies that you just couldn't see. If you're shooting at enemies on the right and running from them to the left, you have no chance to see what are you charging into. What's more, sometimes a special, big enemy will appear after killing normal mob. At that time the camera will center on the big enemy, leaving you powerless to mob and also changing the direction of your shots.  Level design is also weak. For the most part I was convinced that levels are generated randomly, but no, they're just so uninspired. Levels consist of simple geometry and usually will take shape of a long, curved corridor to the end of the level. Only third world have some more variety, with buildings, fences and rivers that divide areas naturally and that offer something that resembles exploration. Too bad there's nothing to see. One thing that stands out is that every world has its own protagonist, enemies and tilesets. Different heroes have different guns, bombs and spells. Only sword, or stick, stays the same. Again, third world offers the most with a shotgun and molotov cocktails that create burning trap for charging enemies. At least enemies offer some variety. We have enemies that chase us, shoot at us, or shoot at us during a chase. We'll destroy trucks, kill terrorists and animals, we'll cut down plants and put some zombies out of their misery. Occasionally we'll get a power-up that will heal us, offer a limited invulnerability, nullify cooldown for spell or kill all enemies on screen (this time dealing set amount of damage to all creatures). I found that charging into enemies with invulnerability and cutting them down in mad rampage yields higher chance for power-ups. That way you could kill most of your enemies by running from one power-up to another, and since your running speed is so high it might be a recommended way to play this game.  At the end of the worlds are bosses. Not much can be said about them other than that they're big, chase you and shoot you with lasers. The one boss that is actually pretty good is in world 2 - three tanks that shoot at you and drop explosive barrels which in turn can be used for extra damage. It's still janky but at least boss stays in the upper part of the screen, whereas other bosses you'll just circle around to death. What about graphics? You can see it's actually ugly. It's not 8-bit, it's not 16-bit, it's 32-bit with awful color scheme and unfitting lighting effects, with strong screen shake.  Music is also pretty basic and it might actually be good, if it weren't for generic samples. All in all an attempt has been made. Game can be finished in one sitting, but offers little variety and uneven challenge. Good ideas are hidden under misconceptions and simple game loop will tire you fast.",0,0,en

"it seems like opinion of majority on ROTT'13 based on some sort of nostalgia and feeling, that ""old means good"". Do not let it deceive you: while on surface ROTT'13 wrapped in extremely fast andrenalin pumping gameplay and flavoured with juicy remixed metal soundtrack of original game, deeply below, something definitely rotten here. First, bugs: from minor graphic distortions on enemy models to game-breaking, when final boss, who is not pushover, even on lowest difficulty, may stuck in textures, or some traps completely stop working after manual loading.  I even got BSOD at one moment, because game created a huge 80 gigs (!!!) log file, and tried to read it. Second, even in new shining cover, ROTT'13 feels like a budget game. There are only few types of enemies, some guns are too similar, one-liners of characters are not memorable, and levels are too short. Yes, its a remake, but even in 1995, original game wasn't a very remarkable (mostly, because it' was released too late in history of FPS). Overall, its a strange mix of top-notch fast shooting and explosions with some poorly executed mechanics. Buy it with discount, if you want, but it is difficult to say, will you experience fun or frustration.",0,0,en

"Critical Mass asks a simple question: What happens when you turn a Match-3 game into a 3D model? And that is what you get: A mass of cubes that requires you to match 4 cubes of the same colour to clear the level, and the idea alone is rather fascinating... ...Except that the main mode is basically a time trial mode, where the mass of cubes expands all the time and explodes at ""critical mass"" level. Once it does that, the whole level restarts and you lose all your previous power-ups. I find this implementation frustrating, as it never gives you the right breathing room to think about your cube placements. I understand that there is a Zen Mode where you are free to clear cubes at your own pace, but the fact that I can't play through the vanilla ranked mode properly leaves a bad taste to me. If only they have a time limit for each level instead of making the mass of cubes a timed bomb, I would have enjoyed this game much more.",0,0,en
"I play this quite a bit on my tablet, and decided to try it on Steam as I received a Beta Key. Right away I was asked to purchase goods, (this game is 100% P2W - cash grab) After playing for about 10 minutes I had to quit. The game was built for touch screens and trying to click on items, scrolling, and general playing was extremely non intuitive for non-touch screen play. This is still a Beta but I had hoped they would have coded more in terms of keyboard/mouse mechanics instead of just porting over a game built for mobile phones. All in all, it is a fun game, but remember that this game is designed to beam funds from your wallet to the developers. You'll see that within the first 4 minutes of playing.",0,0,en

"Great game! there are so many posibilites for this rpg, we did wait long for this and finally its out! And it SUCKS, mostly because ubisoft sucks and opens every door for hackers and glitch-user, like 30% of the players are hacking and u cant even find players to play normal missions with u, cause everyone just uses glitches. Not much late game content, not much to do besides shooting mobs in DZ all day and get shot by hackers from time to time. Besides this major problems im even disappointed by social system or/and reporting system. Way to annoying u cant report ingame, or a whisper function in the friendlist or something similar would be nice. And Ubisoft seems like theres no problem, just keep releaseing new missions which are easy to glitch and that will fix everything... Also, on a side note, american players get bonus items, europe accounts cant achive because they sold it more often there. Well okay, but why the hell we get on the same servers if they got an advantage anyway??  No sense in this, but well doesnt matter cause all in all u cant play pvp for more than 3 minutes without beeing killed by hackers anyway, so ♥♥♥♥ it.

"First of all, this is not a game. It's a little program in which you have to click on a button to raise your points and gain achievements. That's all. This ""game"" has 5000 achievements, that you gain in a few minutes just clicking on the big button and buying upgrades to raise your score faster. There is a repeating music (which is cute, but annoying after a few minutes), which also stops after a while because the game is bugged.

"DO NOT buy this game....at least not until they fix the connectivity issue many people are having.  I DLed the game while it was free to play over the weekend and it ran perfect, might have gotten disconnected once or twice, but no big deal and it reminded me a little bit of EverQuest, which I really enjoyed, so I bought it.  After I bought the game maybe a day or two later I began having connectivity issues, either I couldnt get past the character selection screen or Id get into the game and play for a minute or two before getting disconnected.  I could play in the early part of the day but around noon cst Id get disconnected and wouldnt be able to get back on again until the next day to actually accomplish something which is a problem in the game, especially if you bought a time sensitive package like I did and cant claim the daily check-in rewards.  Looking at their reporting page it seems its been going on a while, so, might wanna check that out before buying, see if the reports stop coming in first before buying.  The game itself is good, kinda grindy, which if you dont mind that kind of thing, makes it really good.  Its got your basic life skills, cooking, metal and wood working, fishing, processing, horse taming and breeding, etc throw in some gardening and mini games with tons of quests, you get a good time consuming game.",0,0,en

"Currently, this game is filled with game breaking bugs and it isnt even possible to play it properly. i've managed to somehow reach level 10 when i was playing around a week or two ago, but now NPCs and items on map are missing. Specifically the place where the missions are selected, it doesnt appear or work at all. Game GPS thingy instructs me to walk into the entrance,  but it the enterance isnt there at all. A lot of NPCs which are crucial for progression are missing as well. I tried to make a new character in different faction in hopes of fixing this issue, but now i cant even play the first mission properly, so im stuck in first NPC area without any NPCs there. Even after i managed to enter the first dungeon/mission with my new character, mobs didnt take any damage, and there was no cooldown on my skills - game was basically broken.  I tried to restart game few times but only message i had now was - ""Access to mission prohibited (ERROR_NPC)"", when trying to enter the dungeon. I tried doing bunch of things like moving around to different area, restarting the game, abandoning quests and taking them again, but none of those worked at all. Someone said that all of this is caused because ""NPC server"" is offline, so i'll take that as an explanation for now, since i cant understand why it would be broken otherwise out of nowhere. IDC needs to step in and fix this, otherwise dont even bother downloading this, since you wont be able to play it.",0,0,en

"Overall 1/5 - It's now worthy of 1 star! xD TLDR: Ironsight is a COD ripoff with P2W rigged matchmaking.  Wiple IS has a few improvements over the Aeria Games version: - New players now get more rewards (Now they can actually buy some guns and optics, because the K2C is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with it's weak damage and lackluster range it get's outperformed by most guns at close range and long range.) - There's now a shooting range to test guns, before you waste your credits on some useless ♥♥♥♥ weapon. - There's an optional Battle Royal mode (haven't tried it yet). Ironsight *STILL* comes with the following problems: - Bad developers/moderators/content creators/streamers that ban you from the forums if you give criticism about Ironsight. - A toxic community that is rude and disrespectful, especially if you are a newer player. (Did you, a level 1 player get massacred by a level 500? ""Git gud!"" is all these toxic, poor sportsmanship players have to say, even though they have the unfair advantage.) - Pay To Win (repair system to eat your credits, special bullet types, special explosives, boosters, lootboxes with weapons and attachments inside). The next section about rigged matchmaking expands on this. - Rigged matchmaking system (It puts low levels like under level 50 against players who are level 100+, 300+, or even over level 500! These higher level players not only have more experience, map knowledge, ect; but also much more better gear. This is not only unfair, but it's designed to make new players want to just go out and buy items just so they can get it in a reasonable amount of time. It's a pay to win tactic, and it needs to be put to an end.)  This is the same system used by Activision, which the way this game Ironsight is basically a clone of COD which is a Activision game. [ ""For instance, the microtransaction engine may match a more expert/marquee player with a junior player to encourage the junior player to make game-related purchases of items possessed/used by the marquee player,"" the patent reads. ""A junior player may wish to emulate the marquee player by obtaining weapons or other items used by the marquee player. ""In a particular example, the junior player may wish to become an expert sniper in a game (e.g., as determined from the player profile). The microtransaction engine may match the junior player with a player that is a highly skilled sniper in the game. In this manner, the junior player may be encouraged to make game-related purchases such as a rifle or other item used by the marquee player.""] - Bad (but now improved) progression system (Some attachments, like the compensator for reducing recoil take hours to unlock, and it's just for one gun. New players won't be able to use them (as they haven't grinded for hours yet...DUH! At least they get enough credits to buy actual sights now (for example, the HAMR is very versatile with a holo and a scope for long distance shots in one handy package) and now new players can buy it. - Bad netcode (new players already struggle, now let's throw bad hit detection, lag, and desync on top of that! That way, kills that they should of got, well... get ignored! Don't worry, you'll pay for every bullet you fire with the repair system, or lose your gun when you neglect to pay the repair cost. Just read the reviews and you'll find where many others have complained about the bad netcode, and this hasn't been fixed for years!) OLD REVIEW FROM AERIA GAMES VERSION BELOW: Edit: The Aeria Games version is shutting down, but they are replacing it with another version. They are wiping your progress and not going to compensate you fairly for your time, and if you spent money you are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they won't let you keep your items! You'll have to start completely over, and you'll be disadvantaged when you go up against the players who have been playing this other version for years! TLDR: Pay to win, just like Warface, but with a worse repair system and worse grind only made worse by the extremely bad netcode problems. At least they don't have blatant super overpowered exclusive paid guns yet. Matchmaking is a mess as there is no fair matchmaking. It's completely rigged! As a new player you will be playing level 100, 200, or even 300+ players. This game has been out for a long time, it's only ""new"" to Steam. I've played this game for several hours before it ever made it to Steam so whatever I post here in my review is 100% accurate. The netcode for this game was originally TCP, which is not recommended for realtime applications from a development standpoint. The reason that is, is because TCP favor data reliability over high speed latency. TCP will resend packets (the data that contains your character location information, shooting, etc) until they pass, while UDP which is used by most multiplayer FPS games allows for some dropped packets if necessary to keep good ping/latency. The game has switched to UDP, but the netcode is still extremely bad. This is more important nowadays as most internet connections are accessed wirelessly through wifi or directly to cellular networks, which increases latency. Because of the bad netcode, it may appear to many players that they are getting killed by hackers, while often this is the case (there are lots of hackers in this game) it's not always the case as there is also frequent de-syncronization issues caused by the bad netcode.  This often results in players not getting kills, and especially for new players who don't get very many kills because they have bad rigged matchmaking with veterans, worse equipment, and less skill; this may cause them to lose most if not all the kills they were supposed to get. By the end of the match, they then only make a very low amount of credits 50 - 300 which is often only slightly more than the repair cost of their weapon. By the way, new better weapons cost 20,000 so they're very expensive for new players who have not had the many hours it takes to grind a pile of credits. All of these things contribute to making this game pay to win.  Additionally there are special explosives and bullets that are all time limited and can't be bought permanently so that also creates even more of a pay to win situation as only veterans will be the only ones who can afford all that stuff. Of course you can directly buy some premium currency and skip the grind and immediately buy better gear. There are also lootboxes, these do not contain just skins. They often contain attachments for guns. These affect performance as if you don't have one of the guns and you get one from a lootbox it unlocks the gun. Skins in this game are actually not just skins, but they act as full separate weapons.  All guns also come pretty much barebones with like no attachments. Just because you have a scope for one gun does not mean you can use it on another gun. They are a separate grind! They even removed the daily rewards to make the game even a worse grindy pay to win ♥♥♥♥ game! As for the content creators, moderators, and developers; they are completely unable to take constructive criticism and they think their game is perfect or almost perfect despite having severe flaws as I mentioned above. Go read the negative reviews if you don't believe me. Other players have experienced the same sort of issues. Something else to dislike, but has no effect on gameplay, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ corny storyline. It's just bad. Now for what I do like about the game... The graphics look decent and the game runs well even on a entry level gaming laptop. The game is not larger than 20 GB to achieve that either. There's plenty of guns and gun customization (but I don't like the pay to win grind or balance of them, there's actually only a few good ""meta"" weapons) Yeah that's pretty much it.  Rating 0.25/5 That's right, not even 1 star!",0,0,en

"One of the worst ""Souls-like"".   I was giving this game total 3 chances since year 2015 and even now, when I beat whole trilogy of Dark Souls, on mouse + keyboard, it didin't helped me to play this garbage ""lords of the fallen"" more than 2 hours. I was thinking that Dark Souls have slow weapons, clunky animations, stupid camera, but this what I saw in this game is like few times worse. Main ridiculous problems with this game: 1. Many weapons are so slow that there is no time to make hit, especially when enemies attack you few times in a row, you avoided, you want hit, but before you end swing, enemies again strarted combo or using shields. To peoples which knows very slow weapons in Dark Souls games, almost every weapon in LOTF is slow as heavy attack with Ultra Greatswords in Dark Souls. I will not mention here how long is using HEAVY ATTACK, even with one handed axe, that is just ridiculous. Even in real life I could attack faster with some warhammer than this ""muscular"" guy in LOTF. 2. Many enemies have stupid, strong shields, you can hit, but enemy will take like 1-2hp + you will be pushed back, hahah. So player must wait when they decided stoping cover behind shield which are larger than themselves.  3. Boss fights are prolonged, the best example is second boss. He using giant shield (of course), weapon with long range, using aoe which you must avoid. Problem here is that he putting aoe, so player must run a bit and after aoe he is not covered with shield for 3 seconds maybe. Then he again covering. It is ridiculous cause swing with LIGHT attacks very often takes... 2-3 seconds. So there is zero chances to even hit him without fast weapon, and it is just of begining this game. 4. After moment of gameplay there are so overpowered enemies that are actually not beatable without boring ranged attacks or slower melee fight than with first boss. Hey, do you know why they are overpowered? Yes! They again have gigantic shields. 5. Enemies have way to much HP 6. ""Camera lock"" on emeny is more stupid than my cat + propably I could think about more disadvantages, but I don't want waste more time for it. Dark Souls are fair and well balanced + many depends of gameplay style and weapons. Also there are smooth dodge animations compared to LOTF.  I have feling like in ""lords of the fallen"" developers forced you to farm EXP to level up.  I usually recommended buying even annoying games on sales, but not this time. Don't buy this, even on sale. It is just waste of time, especially if you have played Dark Souls and you liked that. Overall opinion: This is just very bad designed and unbalanced game.",0,0,en

"Ok so...i dont know where to begin. I love Lucius series, i really do. At least, an idea of it. But omg, this is unplayable. 1st Lucius game i was losing brightness, abit hard to coordinate...ok, old game i thought. 2nd Lucius was waaaay too short with empty storyline. Pretty disappointing ending. But this is the worst so far. When i started it, i liked weird humor in it, and open town idea until i figured you cant do much. You cant interract much. You cant... do anything when quest get bugged and same sentence repeat over and over again, or when your screen get completely dark. I spent an hour looking for a solution to fix gamma drop. In the middle of the playing just suddenly all get super dark and then i need to edit settings, correct gamma and hope it will fix until some next cutscene ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, getting stuck to the point i need to load game, or people get half burried in the ground, getting into houses thru the walls, shaking screen while you try to fly in a crow form etc...well if anyone is interested i made some screenshots how all look like. I am sure thyere will be more unfortunately. And btw, I just ended chapter 2, i cant wait to see more bugs...yay :( Oh and the graphic is priceless lol. Also warning for those who made mistake by buying this game: dont ever choose last load, choose only autosave. Becase if you do, you will get load from begining of the chapter. And then that load will make new autosave. And then tadaaa, you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Because you dont have your last autosave and you will need to repeat whole chapter.

It distracts from the story.  Just some examples of what I mean: 1) Moving around feels unnatural.  Only 4-axis in 360 degree space.  Terrible when trying to get away from zombies. 2) Sometimes you don't even have control over which direction you can move.  Just forward/back. 3) Camera/view control is limited sometimes.  Can't see 360 degrees around room. 4) Attacking/protecting yourself from zombies is confusing:     a)  Sometimes you have to push them away by pressing Q's and E's.  Doesn't make sense at all.     b)  Other times, you have to go for the head.  Cursor control is slow and clunky, and if you miss the head, you're dead.     c)  Last and my least favorite, sometimes the only thing you can do is decide who to help.  No control of Lee whatsover.  All scripted actions thereafter.  No option to help both people. 5) For a game that prides itself on adjusting the story based on your decisions, in some cases, there isn't enough time to read responses and properly make a decision what to say or do.  The text flashes on screen too fast. 6) Decisions are very limited anyway.  Story feels too linear/scripted.  What if I just want to ditch/ignore people.  Nope, can't do that.  At least with games like Resident Evil, I can run around in any direction around town and not die immediately when I run into zombies, which is more realistic because they walk around so damn slow anyway. 7) Worse thing ever... no real save points/slots.  Apparently, the game autosaves, but you don't really know where or when until you die.  If you quit mid-game and restart later, you may have lost some game progress.  For instance, you may think you've already talked to certain people before you quit the game, but it comes back to a point before you actually did that.  Story is now a little bit different from where you left off. 8) Looking around and interacting with objects is pretty hard because of camera angles/view sometimes. 9) After picking up items, there's no way to inspect objects in your inventory.  You can only use them on people/zombies. 10) Interacting with people is strange.  You walk up to them, hover mouse over them, and then press 1/2/3/etc... to choose how to interact with them based on your inventory of items and whether you can use items on them or not.  Again, too scripted... in a bad way. There were lots of other things that bugged me about the game, but this list is already way too long.  I found it really hard to be immersed in the story, which is the main reason I bought this game.  Really surprised this won over To the Moon in the Steam Awards.  There were some parts of that game that felt out of place (like Whack-a-Mole) as well, but most of the time, it was fun and entertaining.  The Walking Dead just felt like a chore to play for me.  Only on the second episode, and I already feel like I'm forcing myself to finish the game.",0,0,en

"Leaving Lyndow picturesquely walks through summery forests and vegetated fields, preluding to the technical quality of Eastshades' art direction, yet its deceptively brief and hollow journey can be surmised as a demonstration rather than a narrative-driven game. WHAT I LIKED: + One with nature. Lyndow is a bustling village with plenty of beautifully tranquil areas to explore. From majestic woods to a civilised tea house. It's an experience that revolves around world-building, introducing players to the Eastshade world and the style of game that is to come. It is undoubtedly a gorgeous game to look at, with hundreds of assets on the screen at one time and still performing optimally well. Leaves gently blowing in the wind. The crackles of flames in the fireplace. Each environment felt different when exploring and offered a few surprises along the way. + Master of the beads. One of those surprises was a bowl of beads that the player could interact with using the mouse. It's absolutely pointless, but ever so satisfying to watch beads roll around a spherical bowl. It's the small things in life... WHAT I DISLIKED: - An empty shell of beauty. Leaving Lyndow is unfortunately one-dimensional. It lacks characterisation of its protagonist, whom is leaving the titular village to explore vast regions, and other villagers including family members. It is thematically shallow, never really divulging in the hardship of waving goodbye to memories and upbringing. It's also lacking in purpose. For example, finding four straw dolls for the nephew granted no reward whatsoever. Regrettably, Leaving Lyndow resembled a painting without any interpretation. Even the ""light puzzle"" element of the forest wind chimes hand held the player after one or two replays of the melody. - A short advertisement. The studio has admitted that Leaving Lyndow was more of a trial to experience the process of shipping a game and garnering feedback for their big upcoming project Eastshade. And it's abundantly clear that this short walking simulator was nothing more than an advertisement for what was to come. It wets the palette, nothing more. Conceding to a paid technical demonstration, that would help supplement Eastshade's funds, rather than a fleshed out prequel/game. Oh, and by short, I mean 30 - 45 minutes... - Humans? Or dwarvish elves? The character models, despite every single one of them looking incredibly similar from a facial perspective, didn't suit the environments. At all. Their clunky limbs and murky colours contrasted with the vibrancy of Lyndow, consequently producing an unusual aesthetic that felt otherworldly (despite the fantasy setting...).

[---]Repetition : strategy/reusing same character/etc. [---] Fake sense of difficulty: the difference between difficulty is insulting . Normal 30 wave . Hard 45 wave . Extreme 60 wave . Impossible 75 wave . they all the same wave and even the same organize of wave . aka: if ou playing on Hard . the 30waves seen in Normal are rebated in hard and 15 wave after it arethe hard one . hint 45 and every wave higher follow the same method. [++]Voice acting and personality : there is an attempt for plot but it over simplify tho i found voice acting one of the best thing about the characters . it dont make them feel like robots that just attack bloons.

"👎 The game disappointed me. There is too little explanation, you don't know what to do next. The fights are too difficult and unjust, you have to fight against 5-6 opponents who do a lot of damage already in the starting area. You therefore die after just a few rounds. It is hardly possible to relax as the hotel room is always occupied. Spending the night outdoors is also hardly possible, as you need certain items that are difficult to find. All in all much too difficult and I think it's a shame that you can't choose the level of difficulty at the beginning. I uninstalled the game after 4 hours.",0,0,en

"*This review is about gameplay and not graphics. Also skip to the bottom for the main conclusion everything before is just a in depth review* *remember that the game is in early access, so don't go too hard on it.* This game is really fun and non-luck based. I have played most popular battle royale games and this seems the most skill based. Since there are no weapons you can pick up the game requires almost no luck. the only problem to me with this game is the ammo . I feel like every battle I have in this game, I run out of arrows. There is also a problem with the combat. In some fights I will fight someone and they will throw against a wall or corner and spam me untill I die. I also don't feel there is enough action. I takes a while to find someone to fight probably because there are only 10 people. I think the devs should add more health and increase your the wood or arrows you get to add more depth to fights. The fights are way too short for only 10 people in the game. I would like the fights to be like for honor in a way. In for honor you only fight one person, but its an in depth fight where you have dodge and attack at the right moments. This is more like shoot them with an arrow hoping it hits then rush with an axe. They also need to market the game more to increase the number of players. *Out of this review the number one thing thats needs to be added to this game is in depth battles. Make the battles more strategic with dodges and combos. Currently the game is like other battles royale games whrer to fight them for at most a minute, then moving on. The difference between others and this is this only has 10 players. It's ok to have short battles in other battle royales mainly because they have 100+ players and there is constant action.* Conclusion: I alwasy suggest getting free games since there is no loss in money. besides it being free the game needs improvment. I think the graphics are fine, but this review isnt to go in depth with that if anyone want me too just comment. The idea is amazing and the game is still really fun. I don't like playing this solo that much. I would get this game if you have a friend to play with.

The game has a solid 30 hours of gameplay untill it gets boring.",0,1,en
"SPOILERS This was another game that I was looking forward too, but left feeling disappointed. By all means this is not a bad game in terms of controls, it is quite a fun   the span of just over an hour it takes you to beat this game. I beat this in an hour and thirty minutes, that is not acceptable for a 15 dollar game!!!! The game just feels like one big beta, only five weapons which all consist of the usual FPS trope of Pistol, Shotgun, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Melee..the works. Same thing with the enemy variety, all are generic Wal-Mart brand enemies that either charge your position like an idiot or fire at you from a distance. There is a storyline but I don't give a f*ck about it! It is a love letter to DOOM, you are a macho man dude who ends up in hell, you shoot demons...boom! Story done. Being said, the gameplay is fun, I do love shooting the enemies in bloody chunks, but it just feels like a game that is not ready, there is only like 8 chapters in 1 act with a dumpster fire embarrassment of a final boss that is basically a rip off between DOOM 3s Guardian and the Cyberdemon, and you can beat him in under 5 minutes...yay Maybe wait until this game goes for 5 bucks, it's not ready for the big time yet.",0,0,en

"This DLC pack was originally released in 2012, back when RSC was the original developer of Train Simulator. I have mix feelings about this pack which i'll explain down below. This DLC is far from perfect and has serveral flaws with it that haven't been fixed for years back makes up for it in other ways. The price is really good but only buy when there is a sale. Whats included: 3 locomotives:  -ATSF SD75M (Warbonnet) -BNSF SD75M (Warbonnet) -BNSF SD75I (Warbonnet) Rollingstock: 4 (4-Bay) Hoppers 3 Piggy back flat cars 3 Lumber Centerbeams 3 Woodchip Hoppers (Exactly the same as the ones from the Dash 9 Pack) 1 Grain Hopper 1 low gondola This is everything that is included in the pack apart from some scenarios for the Cajon Pass route. However, I need to explain the pros and cons of this pack. Pros (locomotives) -Exterior and interior both very detailed. -Cab light works (Can only be turned on from inside the cab and not from the keyboard) -Step lights work (Can only be turned on from inside the cab and not from the keyboard) -Numberboard lights can be turned on/off (Can only be turned on from inside the cab and not from the keyboard) -Instrument lights (Can only be turned on from inside the cab and not from the keyboard) **Important feature** You have the option to have ""No Driver"" in the cab, this is important for when you want to use the editor and put a consist together. This makes it more realistic. Cons (locomotives) -Sounds aren't that great. -Engine sounds, bell and Horn are exactly the same as the SP SD70M, BNSF SD70MAC, UP SD60M and SD70ACE VOL 1. & 2. pack -Doors & windows are inoperable -Stretchy couplers -Dynamic Brakes are buggy. -Headlights don't illuminate the track well and you can't see them from a distance ( Example of this are the headlights from: Amtrak F59PHI, P42DC, UP SD60M, and F59PH) Pros (Rolling Stock): -You get a variety of different freight cars, thats about it Cons: -Stretchy couplers -Sounds: The cars don't sound like a real heavy freight train.  Final points: The DLC by itself doesn't run well. If you are going to use the locos, use them with caution or don't use them as the lead unit. The DLC's only good aspect of it is all the rolling stock you get. Dovetail needs to update the sounds and fix the bugs. Do not buy at full price.  Score: 5/10 Meh I can only recommend this if there is a sale or if you really want the rolling stock.",0,0,en

You WILL get matched with gold and plat players, even if you are bronze, even if you just started. You WILL get smurfs all other times, times you think ""finally! a fair match!"" Nope.

Again, the game is great to have fun, and when that is your goal then you wont care about balance. But if you do. STAY AWAY! (x3) There is no balance. You will see characters with Aoe abilities the size of the stage that hit like a truck and activate at the speed of lightning. While at the same time you have characters with tiny aoe skills but takes years to go through with up to 2 second recovery times. Yeah, the balance is trash.

This game is absolutely amazing  They catered to streamers with private servers to push positive feedback delayed the game a few times with constant announcements announcements 40 thousand players per server they say not a reskin of ARK they say Shows a trailer as real as no man's sky when it first came out Early access or not the advertisement for this game would fool you into thinking its at least in working condition even a semi working condition is fine but its not. don't buy the game yet in this state until later on if you are looking to support a playable early access game.

"Yuppie Psycho is the first game I've ever refunded on Steam; I love everything about the game stylistically and aesthetically, the mechanics, which I've experienced in these first two hours, leave something to be desired.  Granted, it might've been me being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ player, but not giving enough pencils in the tutorial section, where you can put yourself in a situation where you're having to insert the cassette into the player as the mine repeatedly explodes (the mines being able to repeatedly explode and basically stunlock and then instakill you if there are more than one in close proximity) and you try to tank the damage with health items was frustrating.  I also felt that the proximity/radius of the mines sometimes fluctuated, where the same distance on a previous mine that allowed you to safely pencil them would cause this new mine to explode.  The first boss was also frustrating, where it felt like a case of having to tank damage from triggering mine explosions as the only way of taking down the boss. When I reached the 4th floor and then had to gather up the marketing team, and then had to tank damage through trial and error, and also had to deal with more mines, I knew what was coming probably wasn't for me and I threw in the towel. I felt bad doing so, and refunding the game, cause I liked everything besides those pieces of gameplay, and I know this dev does good stuff, but I just wasn't having any fun.  I wish this dev the best of luck in their future endeavors, and I'll be sure to check out their next game. Hopefully it is a bit more mechanically refined than this one. Ps.

"The game is very well done with some immense maps, I mean these things are BIG, and they are bigger then the ones in the first XL game (the prior one) hence the extra X.  Not much was changed over the older one, but the game was updated to handle the bigger maps/cities that the old one choked on.  All the negitive nacys are just idiots and have zero sense of game desgin.   Game runs far better then the old one, even though I never got very far in the last one.  One thing that is still lacking for a good game is multiplayer, to work together to build a mega city.  The maps are by far big enough to support it.   With Steam Workshop support I am sure someone will figure out how to add it in via modding.  At least this one has steam support so cool stuff like that CAN happen. Overall the game is great if you like to build super cities, and were found lacking in the new Sim City (I felt the same way, game was good but needed bigger building plots).   The game is very playable now (over the old one), however that is all dependent on your computers hardware configuration AND what other programs are running the background. However despite all of that, Cites: Skyline is much more sim city, then this game is, hence now a negative recommendation",0,0,en

"GTA V was alright when it first came out, but now since you can't play the campiagn with mods then what's the point of playing. Like Take Two must not actually play the game if they thought removing mods and banning players that use them was a smart move. I mean if you want to lose a fanbase and make dumb moves then pump out games like Ubisoft and the makers of COD do every year or if you just want to stop making games then become Bethesda. They could use some help with doing a remake of Skyrim, but maybe you are even lower than that. Maybe you are pulling a Valve right now, they do not make games nor do they care about their fanbase all they care about is how much money they can make with their broken and aging games. But to be honest all game makers have been dropping the ball when it comes to making ""Finished"" games and mods created by the community is the lifeblood for any game. Taking away the ability make mods for an unpolished game is a slap in the face for the community and causes a lot of anguish for those that took many hours to make a mod. But why would any gamer maker care, they aren't gamers so they couldn't possibly understand. And if you think I am wrong then why am I having to make this response. So here's my advice take time and make a game right the first time around instead of hiding the issues with patches or DLC.",0,0,en

"I have never been so disapointed of a remake of a game in my entire life. I have played and still play this game on my PS2 and I thought that this game might be similar but just a better graphic. I was sooo wrong... First of the start is completly different. Instead of an awesome green Lambo you get a red Nissan (nothing against Nissan but I think starting of with a Lambo gives you more of a goal). The Cars you get to choose after the... I don't know maybe 5th race or so only have 1 car in common (correct me if I am wrong) and you get to choose many more, which some of you might see as an upside but for me it just takes away the ""challange"". What I also dislike is that you can't drive to the point where the events start by yourself, you can only press Tab to teleport to the race. The speed breaker is also pretty useless because it just slows down your car and in such of a speed that you might just thing about only using it if you are about to crash and you don't want to. All in all from what I've seen is that the only thing this and the original masterpiece has in common are the cutscenes.

"I wanted this to no suck,but i'll finish it incase it get better. It has a dodge meta like Bayonetta dodge just right and you do a powered hit. problem is finding the window to dodge. if you did dodge as the hit is about to connect you get hit, it hit dodge before it gets to you you get hit, if you dodge at the start of the animation of the attack you might not get hit and power hit maybe. In the games defense i'm pretty terrible a dodge only to live games, bloodborne and Bayonetta. yet i can play doidgeball well *shrugs* If your in your ""rage"" mode during a boss fight and it switches to a small cutscene your meter is emptry and off regardless of the amount you had. there a scene with fury where she basically gave in for abit and the beginning of the game she's complaining about being bored. Bsically instead of making this character strong willed like the other two they made her more frail. her bark is worse than her bite. She's one of the four  rider of the apocolypse and somehow is a wuss. She should basically be female ghost rider but she's more akin to Hawkeye. In general i'm just disappionted in the character. leveling up and upgarding gear is straight out of darksouls/demonsouls spend sould to lvl up and spend them to buy parts to upgrade weapons like titaniteshards(slivers of adammite) the shops is the bonfire and you can use them to teleport from  one to the other. if you die your souls drop where you die for easy hit with your weapons and recover them all. It's not a bad system is just lazy, for dark souls it's mostly their thing and it's fine, but anyone else copying this system is just lazy. There's no clever kill animations either for anything hell even as Death and War ya had them as Fury they couldn't be bothered. It's so far a very closed in world more like metrovania unlock new things now you can go here not really a bad thing but not really innovative either.  overall so far it's just ok, not great I'd say it's worth about 20-30$ i got it on sale elsewhere for 46$. the thing i've gained from playing this is the THQ Nordic is on my hell no list, just like EA  Odd thoughts: at this rate Strife's game (if there is one) will just be a clone of Vincent's dirge of the cerberus with Devil May Cry peppered in the way they are currently going.",0,0,en

"To get that out of the way, I’ve never been a fan of rhythm video games. I‘m simply not a very rhythmic person, so naturally, I stay away from rhythm games. How did I get here then? Like many others, I’ve found out that lo-fi beats are great music to concentrate to. Also the art style looked neat and when I saw how cheap the game was, it was a done deal. But in the end, did Lofi Ping Pong change how I feel about rhythm games? To be honest, it almost did... Lofi Ping Pong advertises itself as a “Meditative rhythm ping-pong”. So, before we start looking at the gameplay, what might “meditative” mean?  1) It might mean: mindfulness. Be in the moment and observe how you feel, what you do. Do so without commenting, without judgement. 2) It also might mean: turn off everyday struggle and immerse yourself in an experience easy enough to make you relax but also hard enough to keep you invested. Get in the flow and feel good about it, sort of like that. But how does this connect to a rhythm game about ping-pong? Is it the gameplay or is it the story? Or maybe both? When you play a rhythm game, you don’t necessarily expect a deep story. In that aspect, Lofi Ping Pong certainly is an exception. It’s a clever rendition on the five stages of grief, a meditation if you will. There isn’t much dialogue but from the little there is, you get a good idea of who the protagonist is and find yourself guessing what exactly it is that she’s grieving about. A good cherry on top are the little psychedelic Hotline-Miami infused moments with animal masks   Interspersed with a narrative on grief is something akin to the journey of a ping-pong player that goes pro. This is reflected in the game’s learning curve quite cleverly. You start off only having to beat the ball back to the beat until the progress bar on top of the screen fills up. With each stage, new mechanics are introduced, each a subtle way to disturb your listening/feeling the beat of the track. The AI’s side of the table gets obscured, the beat switches up a bit mid track, the ball switches direction mid-flight, the hitpoints on your side of the table get obscured by a tidal wave. In that aspect, Lofi Ping Pong shows lots of polish, especially in the dead middle of the game, where everything comes into place. The mechanics are challenging, the trap-like beats are neat, you hitting the ball is perfectly reflected in the tracks with a satisfying ‘pling’ each time the direction of the ball is going to change. But unfortunately, not every level has such good feedback, much less satisfying tracks. Lofi Ping Pong is hard. Unforgivingly hard. It’s a rhythm game on steroids. Gameplay in itself isn’t a problem. Press an arrow key for  three directions to hit the ball to: left, up or right. Nothing to mess up here. Nothing overly complicated. The annoying thing is: Should you fail to match the beat you ought to whack the ball to, you have to start over. This gets annoying real quick and will undoubtedly lead you to at least one rage-quit. It’s so annoying because every time you fail, the rhythm drops and you’re completely thrown out of it. Countdown 3.2.1… and you’re thrown back into the beat so quick you have to react immediately. The rating you get at the end of a successfully beaten track doesn't really make sense. What is the difference between getting an A, a B or an S rating? It's never clear as the gameplay seems to be centered about hit the ball or don't hit it. How is any sort of precision (in %) calculated? It feels absolutely arbitrary and I’d have preferred a rating or at least a counter of how many restarts you needed to finish a certain track. When meditating you learn to deal with negative thoughts by observing them neutrally, letting them come and go. Lofi Ping Pong tries to employ that, but it fails. Sure, the gameplay can be meditative, but only as long as it flows well. The moment you get thrown out of concentration and out of the track it starts falling apart. If you’re not rhythmically savvy like me, you’ll find that endlessly frustrating. It isn’t meditative to have to lazer focus on a 30 something-second track. Expect finger cramps due to the extremely simple gameplay.  Lofi Ping Pong has a lot of things going for it. Fairly easy gameplay, investing ‘story’, somewhat consistently good tracks, track editor for your own music, even a coop mode with leaderboards. Also the art style is charming and there is only 5 achievements to get the illusive 100%. But sadly all of this gets buried under the pretentiously hard gameplay. Yes, meditation might mean: dealing with troubling things, learning how to deal with hardships. But damn: this isn’t life. It’s a 4€ game. Edit: When I first played this game, I found myself struggling a lot with it. I wasn’t able to finish it and thus, my original review reeked of saltiness. Now, almost a year later, in these troubling times of Corona and whatnot, I decided to try it again. I was pleasantly surprised by how compelling it was, especially the level in the middle of the game that I talked about further up. But did I change my mind about the game? Not really. It’s a great game with great aesthetics and beats, but the concept in itself is flawed. A perma-death rhythm game in a way. That’s not player-friendly. And not very meditative. But I still appreciate it for what it is and what it tries to do with it’s combination of narrative and gameplay. Also the developer seems to be a cool dude: see comment.",0,0,en

"Insurgency Sandstorm, As much I will like to say I like or love this game, I can't due to performance issues. The developers need to work on the engine to perform better. I'm running this game in a  Nvidia 1070TI 8Gb, i7 4770K 3.5Ghz, 32GB DDR3 and the game is installed in a Solid state WD 500Gb. The game has a great potencial and is my kind of FPS game style.

Starting game..."" but it never connects. The only way to get the game to function after this is to force close it with alt-f4 and restart. I can understand networking issues and lag, but you need to put a timeout in, or improve your servers so this doesn't happen. Duplicate Emotes: So I'm level 18, and you get ~100 coins every 2 levels, so I've opened 14 chests. Of these chests 4 have had ""duplicate emojis"". I only have 6 out of the 30 emojis available so at 1/5th the chance, why are 1/3 of my chests duplicates? I'm paying 150 coins to get a whole 15 back because of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RNG. It needs to be 50 or 75 coins back for a duplicate so I'm not wasting so much time opening useless chests, or at least prevent duplicates until a player has half of the emojis. These are two major issues that are preventing me from recommending the game.",0,1,en
"I think this game has a really neat concept, and after seeing all the positive reviews I was excited to try it. Playing the game for the first time was really fun. It has a decent story and it unfolds nicely as you go along. Unfortunately, this game has zero replayability. Only reason to keep playing is to farm all the achievements. During my second playthrough, I was really disappointed that everything was the same and you already know what's going to happen. So in terms of actual enjoyment, what you really get is a single 10-15 minute playthrough. After that, it's just not that fun. Note - playtime is due to card farming.

"The game is a massive grind, and the devs dont care, if u criticize the game on the forum the u get perma ban WTF is up with that dont u want people to know what wrong with ur game, dont get it its not work the storage space EDIT: this is one of the most pay to win games ever. There are weapons that are clearly over powered and the snipers can one-shot you from any distance without headshot once they are upgraded. as i said the grind is massive and honestly is the worst ive ever seen when it comes to grinding. the graphics are not good for 2017-2018, and let me tell u this one class is 523000 credits, let me explain why this is alot and well overdone, in a match if you have a really good game like 40 kills and like 5-10 deaths with vehicle destroys and point captures you will get about 16000 credits that before you have to ""repair"" your weapons, i mean comeone what type of game makes you pay for just using the guns, just another way for them to make u pay. but you get the choice to spend gold for all of this which i calculated to be worth like 5000 credits each, but you can only get it with real money, they also constantly throw PREMIUM in your face like only have one perk well u can have two if you got premium, which costs more to buy than you get back from it with the credit bonuses unless you sit there all day and all night devoting your life to the game even then it will be hard. The start of the game is fun and you are placed against people who are lol-level like you but once you hit gold hatchmaking you are F*CKED, and they make it seem like a good thing like saying well done now you have gold matchmaking, well sorry but its a horrible thing, as you still have low level gear and are not good but they put you up against people who are max rank have the best weapons and their weapons are fully upgraded, but then again you could just but gold and get all that stuff for yourself. i can understand that its free and that ingame purchases help keep the devs afloat but they have taken it overboard and made this game pay to win, and the cost for things in credits is outragouse as one attachment for a gun can cost as much as a whole new gun and it only gives you like 3% extra damage. also dont be surprised if you have all the stuff  and you have bought stuff because they will perma ban ur ass and then when u ask for an investigasion they are all like ""you were found hacking and we will not take the matter any further"" their customer service is terrible and no help at all, ive seen people say this is another way they get you to pay more because you will most likely make another account and buy all that stuff again and thus give the dev team more money, they make no usefull updates and only seem to make the game worse will their ""patches"" where they same they make the game better but it only becomes worse and more pay-to-win all in all dont even bother with this game, also like i said if you complain on the forum they ban you from that aswell  because they dont want people to know how sh*t their game is, its not even worth the storage space",0,0,en

"I absolutely love the shooters from the first era like Catacombs 3D, Wolfenstein 3D, Blakestone and so one. The developers of this game wanted to recreate the feeling of these games, but honestly, they failed miserably. Let's brake it down to the core elements: The movement is realy uncomfortable. Strafing is much faster as moving forward, turning is too sensitive (yeah, if you don't have a mouse with adjustable dpi settings, you will turn 360 degrees with the slihtest mouse movement) and NOTHING is adjustable in the game. It's something that should have been seen on the first test runs. The graphics would be very nice, the art is realy good at representing the early 90's, but the color palet ruins the visibility in the game. If you use such a low resolution for the game, then you should make the einviroment and the enemies somewhat different. Most of the time you can't recognize anything on the screen. The sprites and textures are realy well drawn, but everything together... it's a pastel mess. The engine has also some texture warping problem. Gees, this was been already solved in 92's Wolf 3D... . The gameplay is the third nail in the coffin. All of the enemies have hitscan attacks and they don't miss... . They can even shoot you through corners. Health pick-ups are all over the place, but if you are nor fast enough you will be shot or ripped to death before you can touch a medkit. You also can't pick up ammo if you are not holding the right weapon. Seriously, what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that? The game could have been good.

"CRIMSON METAL is, an interesting little thing. In the one hand, I'm impressed with the fact that someone made something on the FPS Creator engine that isn't ""complete"" garbage. Even if it's a modded version of the engine, it's still very impressive that they made something playable and run decently. Still has some frame drops here and there, but for the most part, there was some decent amount of effort put into this, and I really have to give the Devs some big credit for it! Even if most assets are pre-made or store bought. Soundtrack is good. In the other hand however, the game itself isn't that great. The enemies are bullet sponges that also dish out way too much damage, especially the hitscan shooting enemies! The movement is not very smooth, jumping almost doesn't exist, and the mouse smoothing is not a welcomed sight. Weapons are OK and are usable. There is a duel wielding system, which is part of the ""modified"" version of the engine, as FPSC did not support such feature originally. I also like how I managed to glitch the game and allow me to duel wield the assault rifle and machine gun at the same time. That was real fun! Having a key feature be the lack of an ""options menu"" is a big no no! No! Don't do that Devs! ... But again, that's the limit of the FPSC engine. This is the problem that always comes down to it, is simply the engine it's built on. FPS Creator is just, a bad engine. Trust me, I've tried my hands at it numerous times. Which again is why I'm impressed they managed to even make something, somewhat stable and working. I know most of the reason for that is because of the modded engine. The long load times, the terrible AI, the clipping, the glitches, it all comes down to FPSC! This also might be why I'm much nicer and more understanding of the limitations of the game, because I have knowledge on FPSC. So I kind of flop on if I liked this or not. For the little fun I was having, I'd get frustrated shortly after. FPSC just kills the game. So for that reason, I have to give this game a thumbs down, cause you know Steam doesn't let us pick a MIXED option. *To think I've only had this game sitting on my PC for TWO F*CKING YEARS and I've finally got around to finishing it...",0,0,en

"So I have finally gotten around to playing The Witcher trilogy. I started out with the first Witcher which despite it's age showing through, and the clunkiness of it, it was quite an enjoyable game.  Then it was time to play this game, and it has not been a good experience at all.  First of all, all the controls have changed, and there is a new combat system in place. I have gotten used to it, But I absolutely hated it when starting playing. It is simply a completely different game. And that might be fine, so I'm not going to let that affect my judgement. However, the controls are incredibly clunky and if you walk too close to something, or look in the wrong direction, it will not let you interact with it. Which means you have to reposition your character and move your view angle around to find the right spot that lets you interact. The camera view for letting you interact is very narrow which makes this rather annoying. To spot items you can interact with, you have use your medalion, which send out a pulse which causes items to shimmer for a short while, but only near you. This does only work after standing still for a while, and doesn't let you spam it. This makes spotting items to interact with a very tedious experience, because there is loot Everywhere! Carryweight is limited to 250, there is no way to increase this.  There is a mission at the very start of the game which lets you get up to 300, IF you clear it a certain way. and an item which adds 5. (I only know about this by googling). Which means once you got fed up with the game nagging you about being encumbered, which it does ALL the time if you are, you have to start a new game. Because it is really easy to get enough stuff to go over that limit. being encumbered means not only does the game remind you of this every 10 seconds by flashing it on the screen, but you also only move at sneaking pace. Needless to say your storage is not available to you for big parts of the game.  Cutscenes, animations and QT events Everywhere ALL the time. My favorite is in the first chapter when your dwarf friend starts arm wrestling. Which because the text describing what do was bright yellow on a white background, was completely invisible. So of course the event fails. The second time around I only managed to spot something was displaying just as it failed. and its a button masher. Really?  Every door, even if its already open displays a walk-through animation. The cutscenes are numerous. By the time I finished Chapter one and got into Chapter two, I was already fed up with them. But this made me want to just uninstall. I quit playing that night in disgust. There is a long cutscene, where you change over to control the king, and the whole purpose of that is to walk very slowly, a really long distance, just so that the other cutscene can start. There is nothing else to do in that part. just mindlessly boring, slow walking. and at the end of that next cutscene you are suddenly dumped into a fight.  For 5 minutes I simply stared at the screen, not caring. But of course of the character I was ""controlling"" was in god-mode so it just tanked all the damage it got until I finally killed the attackers. absolutely pointless! At times you barely get to play the game at all since all you do is move a few steps into the next cutscene.  bad minigames The armwrestling is a button masher event. The fist fighting is a QT event. and the dice throwing is just badly designed.  I am not a fan of QT events so me disliking that is only to be expected. But I honestly don't think they have a place in an open world RPG. I guess if you are ok with QT events then disregard my critique.  But the dice throwing is just very clunky. The camera angle makes it difficult to see and throw. The Dice are difficult to read, roman numerals ??? really? It is also very easy to throw the dice too hard, or wrongly placed, which means you have to finish the round with less dice. because dice falling off the table just disappears.  The ""Enhanced"" part  I assume the way the graphics looks is because of the enhanced settings, and the original game didn't look like this when it came out.  It makes the whole game look like a 14 year old kids applied every photoshot filter it could find. If you have ever seen a HDR-Fails photo, you know what to expect. Everything is oversaturated, overcontrasted, overbloomed, overshadowed. . . basically every setting is turned way past the maximum level, turning the game into something looking like a 90s webpage full of dancing hamster animatiors and flashing banners.  Even after disabling lots of settings to make it look a bit more sane,, the game somehow reverts into ""enhanced"" mode for the cutscenes. And that is why I hate it. (especially that king bit,, see above) Crashing.  Granted this could be a local issue for me (haven't googled it) but the game just quits suddenly. there is no crash message its just gone! Meaning you have to save often to avoid having to redo a lot of stuff.  And the final straw... The game breaks after too many saves.! The game keeps every save file you make, and once you reach 1000 files it simply STOPS SAVING GAMES! I think the fact that I have exactly 1000 files in the save folder is no coincidence, and I have found no evidence pointing to anything else when googling and finding LOTS of hits on this problem. (apparently deleting save files doesn't help, it still doesn't save games.)  My last savefile was made just at the start of the 3rd chapter. just after dumping pretty much everything I really dont need just to stop the encumbering issue. (when going into the end of chapter 2 I stored a lot in storage, but the game keeps dumping epic swords and armor at me.)   Anyhow, I spent a few hours playing the game, Saving my progress as I went along. The game clearly stated Game Saving...  as normal, but after the game suddenly just exits, there are no savefiles to be found! After doing this Twice!, I started googling it and tested it. I located all the places where the game can save, and saved a game, then checked the folders. no new files!  It simply stops saving, Despite saying it saves the game. It is simply impossible for me to finish this game, since I am sure it will crash before reaching the end of it. So here we are,, A Witcher game which is best avoided.  I would like to recommend this game, because you don't want to miss out on the story between witcher 1 and 3.  but I can't. I really can't. I want to recommend it for the story, but it's so annoying that I can't. Skip it, watch some youtuber play it, and move on to Witcher 3. If you decide to play this game I would like to recommend that you do this... 1. make sure to do that storyline where you get 300 carry weight, because you're going to need it. 2. don't save too much, or find a fix.  (I googled a bit before writing this, and I will look for a fix, but haven't found anything yet, I hope there is a fix.)",0,0,en

"If the games greatest strength is the immersion of a charming imaginative unique alien world, it's greatest weakness is destroying that immersion. I came into this game knowing absolutely nothing about it. At first I was taken aback by the beautiful art direction of the game. It's not the best graphics out there but during my playthrough I was constantly struck by how alien the world felt. Regardless of its foreign nature, it was an immersive experience that sucked me in as everything contained so much wonder and mystery. I was hooked. But then I was taken out of the world because of the gameplay. You move past different areas trying to avoid detection from overpowered enemies. Imagine trying to take on Thanos naked and armed with a wet sock. Running into an enemy is certain death... or at least it should be. It's incredibly easy to fool the enemy by hiding in the surrounding environment. For these technological death robots that are centuries more advanced than us, they sure are dumb. So it's more like going up against a depressed Thanos who much rather be at home in bed watching Netflix. Okay not a big deal. But it gets worse. It's fatal flaw is how frustrating the gameplay can be. Each section is a puzzle that you have to navigate by timing your movements correctly and outsmarting the dumb robots. Which is great but the timing felt completely random and almost buggy. Sometimes the enemy would just get stuck and the only way to reset it is to die and try again. When they weren't stuck, they would walk around seemingly at random times making it more a game of chance rather than skill. I wanted to keep playing but the lack of precise gameplay killed it for me. There are a ton of better games out there and this frankly isn't worth your time.",0,0,en

"Stone is a self-titled 'hip-hop stoner noir', inspired by modern classics of the noir genre like The Big Lebowski and Inherent Vice. What could have been an okay- ish visual novel has instead been turned into a lacklustre 3D adventure game set in the city of Oldtown, Australia. Tune into aussie developer Convict Games' first ever game that sets out for grandeur but falls hard during the entire course of it's very short 60-80 minutes playtime. +Impressive set list of licensed songs  +Virtual copies of classic movies -Lacklustre voice-acting -Superficial references -Repetitive gameplay -Unnecessary title screens -Extremely short -Overly long epilogue -Mystery for mystery's sake -Lacklustre open-world -Lifeless environments The protagonist Stone is a koala. He loves hip-hop. He's also a Private Investigator who's pretty bad at his job. A job he doesn't seem to care about much anyway as he spends his days getting stoned or getting in all sorts of trouble due to his drinking problem. One morning however things go downhill fast. His chookie Alex has gone missing, even kidnapped it seems. That's at least what Stone is made to think when he gets a mysterious call. So, despite his lazy nature Stone is forced to get himself together, were it for him to see Alex ever again. First things first, he needs to retrace what happened the night before. As Stone deduces from his trashed apartment, whoever took Alex must have done it violently. So he sets out and revisits all the bars and clubs he is a regular of. On his journey, Stone gets help from his buddy Les (a wombat and big Kanye West fan), the tough police chief Devil (a Tasmanian Devil who went to police school with Stone), and others. Stone's storyline is mainly inspired by The Big Lebowski and Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice. Developer Convict Games' writers try so hard to imitate, that they completely fail to present anything worth a mention outside this review. The one thing they manage to do right however is the overarching plot-structure. The Dude in The Big Lebowski, very much like Stone in this game, is a very chill dude that gets pulled into something he cannot possibly comprehend due to a major misunderstanding. With a little help from his friends however he manages to live through it all just to get some non-sensical and entirely anti-climactic closure in the end. And much like Doc Sportello in P.T.Anderson's Inherent Vice there's also lots of trouble as Stone forgets things on the regular due to his abusing various substances. Just like in those two movies, the audience never feels like they see the whole picture, like they would ever be able to. Stone claims to be 'reference-heavy'. Those references however are limited to either names-dropping (e.g. El Topo or The Holy Mountain) or simple imitation (Stone's buddy Les is dressed like The Big Lebowski's Walter Sobchak/ Stone himself is dressed like Inherent Vice's Doc Sportello). Character Stereotypes/ Connections are also 'referenced' as in the tough Devil (see Doc Sportello's counterpart Christian „Bigfoot“ Bjornsen ) trying to recruit his nemesis Stone despite their different approach to investigations. Forget the influences however and all there is left is an overly convoluted mess of a story with characters as cleverly written as any given bad reality show. The player can never really get a grasp on how and why Stone got his job. He never seems to be able to figure out things on his own. Each and every piece of new information he finds out through speaking with someone else. The exact same 4 characters during the course of the entire game. Stone's plot is split into 5 chapters, each consisting of 5-6 distinct scenes and an overly long epilogue spanning across the same number of screens. Each and every scene comes with it's own title- card that explicitly tells you what to expect. Each scene lasts about ca. 2-3 minutes. Playing through it all is excruciatingly boring as it doesn't consist of anything else except talking to the same characters in the same locations again and again. Important information is also repeatedly repeated, just in case the player has forgotten.  Something unexpected happens at the end of every chapter. All conceived as cliffhangers but none of them really work out that way. Once the credits roll, none of the twists actually hold up. They're just overblown pieces of exposition and misinformation that don't make any sense. The player controls Stone from the 3rd person perspective. He walks around and interacts with items or characters, all indicated with a giant pink ball floating over them. When space bar is pressed, Stone stops and lights himself a herb cigarette or starts dancing awkwardly (if in the night club). There is a total of 4 environments, each containing a number of interactions that can be counted on one hand. In an overview of Oldtown's map, the player is also offered the choice where to go to next in a failed attempt to establish an open-world of sorts. He can choose to either follow where the story leads him, go back to his apartment or go to the cinema to watch an old movie. Stone doesn't have any puzzles. It's a game entirely built around dialoguing. In those, you're always offered a 'soft touch' and a 'tough guy' approach. This choice is entirely decorative as you always get the same responses. This also implicates decisions that might influence the story in some way. That's also wrong. There's only one ending. Convict Games used Unreal Engine 4 for creating Stone. That doesn't come to full fruition however as all of Stone's models and textures are low-polygon and low-definition. Only some real-world art that pops up in one of the locations seems to have high-resolution. Besides, all the movies available in the in-game cinema are terribly grainy and stretched out awkwardly in a wrong format to fit the screen. Stone contains such a massive set list of licensed songs that there's at least one song included in each scene. Ranging from stoner rock to hip hop to house, there's a little bit of something for each taste.  None of the characters is voiced particularly well (except Stone). They are all stand-out examples for certain accents (mainly aussie) but fail to convey any kind of emotion. The worst examples are Devil, who sounds like a shy school girl instead of a tough detective, and Alex, whose voice resembles a robot's. As mentioned before, there's a title-card preceding all scenes. This takes the player out of any immersion they could have found themselves in. At the end of each chapter there is also a title- card saying 'End of Chapter X' with yet another licensed song playing in the background. That is supposed to fit the mood but rarely, if ever, does so. Stone is a perfect example of how high expectations can completely break a game. By naming stuff like The Big Lebowski as an influence, Convict Games try to be so bold, yet manage to be nothing but overly pretentious. It also doesn't help much that Stone is extremely overpriced. The 15€ for an experience that barely reaches 90 minutes, offers no replayability whatsoever and is so dull it will feel like a chore to play through.",0,0,en

"Absolutely horrible. I don't know how you butcher such a simple concept so badly. This is pong, yet somehow the controls are confusing. The tutorial says hold down the shoot button to charge a shot, but after that my ship just starts charging and shooting random shots independent of my controller inputs. I'm assuming there are some kind of game mechanics that are at work but they don't explain anything so I have no idea what's happening. It could just be the lag because for some reason the game responds to controller input really slowly so maybe my shots are just so far behind the actual button presses that it's creating a complete disconnect between my inputs and the actual action. The only other player in the game has a firm grasp on it however so he keeps beating the ever loving crap out of me. This game concept was already perfected 50 years ago, all you had to do was put a coat of polish on it and market it with a basic level of competence. How you screw that up is beyond me.",0,1,en

"-A beautiful vast game with a lot of variety in it You always find new things. Different systems that contain different planets with different biomes which are all different, even in the same ones you see a new thing. You can build, mine, farm, having your spaceship and a robot u can drive and fight with it and upgrade them, and different missions. And the graphic is too beautiful. -The only problem that makes the game bad, is that the gameplay is too long and the process of taking resources to upgrade yourself and your mech(robot) that allow u to advance the story and new type of systems, planets and resources are too long. To advance in the story u should advance to a new type of systems(5 types) that contain new planets that require a new suit to survive, further each type of systems has new ores u need to mine to build new things and upgrade your mech. It just taking a loot of tiiiime, oh come on!!",0,0,en

As fun as this game is (not that fun) its impossible for me to reccomend it because it crashes every 15 minutes and locks up steam. My PC is decent (1060+g4560) but no matter what settings I play the same thing happens. I have played all the Dead Rising games apart from 1 and this game kind of a step back. The Devs tried to fix it and they definately did fix some things although I don't understand how it ran worse than its current state.

"Tons of issues with this game, although it can be interesting, little thought was given to how progression takes place in game. Progression is locked behind puzzles that make little to no logical sense (some do and others are just not on par), not forgetting to mention the constant backtracking over dialog to move the story along (it gets annoying fast). The art seems to be the strongest piece to this game and yet it falls incredibly short on the adventure piece of the overall experience. Unless you are looking to be frustrated, avoid this one like it is COVID-19. EDIT:  Thought I would further elaborate on the issues I mentioned here:  Here is a brief video on one example of how one of the puzzles is structured. In this example, pressure pads which have to be pressed in a certain sequence - the problem is not necessarily the difficulty itself, but rather how the trigger interaction itself is really buggy, and IMO is unnecessarily cumbersome and makes you not want to continue with your play through:",0,0,en

From the first hours playing this game i'm already knew how the story goes without even seeing spoilers or guides. the gameplay is ""OK"" not so great also no so bad either but for combat this game lacking flashy moves or Supermoves also characters movement and attacks are so stiff not fluid unlike Tales series. i know it's 2 different game but the concept are same it's an Action Jrpg. Characters customization also limited as well since in this game doesn't have equipments like weapons or armors to change, All you had is 1 weapon for each characters and from there all you can do is put rune/aspect to boost your overall stats or skills. The only stand out point this game had is having so many famous Japanese VA [Voice Actor] so i recommend you to play with Japannese Voice not the English dub. it is worth to buy this game at full price??

It would all be all right for free but not for 20$. Tricks feel great and resposive but that's the only good thing about it. You can only rely on community made maps and mods. Even with all that there is no reason to play it for longer than 10 minutes at a time because there are no missions or objectives. I know this is an indie project but for 20$ it's just a scam. Hopefully I'll get my money back.",0,1,en

"I rarely don't finish a story-driven single player game. I actually can't even remember when the last time was, because I usually find something to enjoy no matter the amount of drawbacks.  That is not the case with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. This steaming heap of boredom is probably one of the most forgettable experiences I've ever found myself trying to enjoy. That says something, because I've read ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" AND ""Catcher in The Rye"".  Deus Ex: Mankind Divided isn't a bad game. The mechanics are rather enjoyable, the views are sometimes amazing, the prologue reminded me a great deal of Spec Ops: The line's main setting in Dubai, and it was very beautiful. There were a lot of throwbacks to earlier DX-games, and everything feels like it should make for a very enjoyable experience. However! This is where I try to explain why I find this game so horrible. First of all: Every person the player meets feels like they've been written by an 8 year old with a bog-standard character creation sheet from a D&D-session. It just feels like every reply is formulated, every line is taken out of some sort of matrix of the most stereotypical replies to pressure, taunting, niceties, etc. It's just boring. Bland. Annoying in the end. I never felt like I was in the story for any other reason than its own progression, and that does not a satisfied player make. At least not this player. The locations were (until my early out-bowing) very well-made, although they did feel slightly down-scaled. I found myself constantly trying to sneak around like I always do, but it didn't feel as rewarding as it did in Human Revolution. Again, I just couldn't shake the feeling of me only being around for the story to progress. I didn't sit around thinking ""♥♥♥♥ yeah, I'm gonna save the world here"", there was no feeling of imminence or importance. Just a feeling of ""meh"". To sum it all up. I didn't enjoy the game. I didn't wake up Saturday morning thinking only about playing on and seeing where the story took me. I just felt like replaying a good game instead. Sad. TL;DR: Don't buy this game if you expect good writing.",0,0,en

"I do NOT recommend this game. It just don't have the elements that i want to see in FPS games. I like surviving  scenarios in this type of games(eg:Zombies on CoD: Black Ops 1&2 or L4D). And this is a competitive FPS game. NOTE: I don't have any exp. on other cs games.(maybe cause i do not like them.) Let's be more subjective: I do not like competition on almost anything that needs effort. It's just not my type of entertainment also. I do not like to play and talk with people i do not know. It's an important thing in this game to communicate with your ''team mates''(who are mostly toxic/ if you see one of your team mates on a sidewalk, you will just keep walking-run away; this is what they are.) NOTE: Don't forget that i'm being SUBJECTIVE (you can think that i am just a douchebag/i'm not.) We talked about ''team mates'', let's jump to another topic that i want to mention. STRESS AND ANXIETY/a lot of them: I never tought i was gonna exprience this amount of pressure on my chest. Or  if i imagine that i would say: ''This feeling is caused by an exam, a killer is trying to catch me, ISIS, 911 etc. But... NO! This feeling that we call being stressed is caused by this fricking game. This is not a feeling that i should feel when playing this game. THINGS THAT CAUSED THIS: GAMEPLAY: It's basic. But if you are a low skilled person we have hax to support you. VARIETY OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE: That is where the game shines. This list can be pages long btw. PLAYING WITH FRIENDS: When you play with some real-life friends you can enjoy every second of it. SKINS: Buying a skin for a virtual gunmodel can be a stupid idea. But it is 2018. Some people hate it but i really like the skin economy. You can buy/sell things for real life money. And you can lose all of that in just one game of roulette.(VALVE, PLS DONT BAN ME, I DO NOT HAVE ANY TIES WITH BAD PEOPLE, I DO NOT OWN A SITE,pls no ban, i can give you a free bj) CASE KEYS: This is another case to talk to. This was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ currency just like tf2 keys. You can trade skins with them,gamble them, sell them, buy card sets and games from bots, lose your virginity... OR you can open up a case and lose 2.50 USD.(Cause there is no opskins XD)/Btw i hate using that ''XD'' AIMING: You aim for being a no-life global rank player who has aids, who has a history of wow and who likes to have a gamer/slave girlfriend.(cause only men allowed in this game, no ♥♥♥♥ for u.) BTW aiming is a thing that you can get used to in just 2-3 matches. E-SPORTS: Chubby asians who sits on fancy chairs with 10k people watching them play.

"So............... I found out about this game today, and it looked quite promising, at least I thought. I played about fortyfour minutes of it. First issue I found, was the gamma/brightness, either it was to dark or to bright and very blurry looking. Having it set at 50% I could not navigate dark areas it was that dark (pitch black)   Moving became impossible in the dark, so much so, I had to put the gamma/brightness at 100% to be able to move out from where I was on four occasions, clearly not a good sign Graphically, it was okay, apart from purple blood. Now, correct me if I am wrong, is blood purple? I can forgive most things in games, but not that, unless the devs know some pretty strange folk that bleed purple blood. Some may say ""you did'nt give it a chance"" or ""you have not played it for long"" so how can I comment on it? Well, its like this........................ Imagine this game like a blind date, within five-ten minutes you should know if your going to like and enjoy. You wait a little longer to see if things improve. After forty minutes, you make an excuse for the lavvie/toilet, and don't return/refund. From the vids on the store page it looked pretty damned good, but After paying and playing it, its like two different games in my opinion. You might enjoy it? Watch the French film martyrs instead or the Chinese film Dream home if you want gore and brutality, as they make this game look like bedknobs and broomsticks. I had more fun playing Inmates and Silent descent (hint). Unless it gets modded or patched to make it realistic and playable, I will give it a wide berth.  It should have been a good game, but I found it highly dissapointing. Which is a shame. If it improves, I will re buy.",0,0,en

"The Crew 2 My Sums Only buy this game on sale, first game did better then this in term of gameplay, story etc Play this game only, when you have friends. First The map feel very empty. Second  There is no story mode in this game, only racing first game did it better. Third Flying event is very bad in term of task needed to be done. Griding is less painful in the second game The Wraps are nice addon. Customize was Better then first game had more parts. This is just a Downgrade. Cons You need 3 Monitor for FOV Slider like the first game. Bikes are ok Monster Trucks handing is bad Drifting meh Flying worse then GTA Boats Rally? Rated this game 5.7/10 This just feels rushed.

"Quite addictive in the beginning, sniping in this game feels great man, I gotta give it to the team it feels so much like COD, if you're used to trickshot and quickscope you'll get some pretty interesting sprees, but.... Gets boring really quick, super bad anti-cheat you get matched against blatant cheaters in 50% of the time, where some of them are so hardcore that they are even invisible on the tab menu (no way to kick them) and even use unlimited ammo, aimbot and fast fire, what for me seems like a pretty greedy company who does not even fix their anti-cheat or simply upgrade their own for a better one, and the ""PayToWin"" in this game is insane, just so you're aware even for changing your crosshair you must pay and mostly it is not even permanent.

"Hitman 2 is a very lackluster title. The core mission set for this game is 6 missions + time based exclusive missions released every month.  It is expected that after you finish the very short campaign that you keep replaying the same missions over and over to explore other ways to complete these missions. The cover for the lackluster story and missions is that the levels are ment to be a sandbox for the player to decide how they wish to proceed with a mission. Although I have enjoyed replaying the missions, the campaign and its story are extremely lacking for a $84 AUD game (base price without dlcs or special editions). It is like having a bowl of ice cream without any toppings and its just one scoop. Its good but it really is missing a large amount of content that can be only supplemented though spending more money on dlcs and upgrades.  The game hints you into buying additional campaign missions from the previous episodic hitman release a few years ago and the special edition pre-order mission offered for that game as patient zero. It has a lot to be desired.  If you're interested in playing this game, get it while its on special but be warned that you'll go right though the campaign quick so you'll probs want all the content in a special edition in about a year. We'll see if it improves but atm its only worth the buy if you've got money to waste.  Suggest buying Hitman Absolution instead if you want a full proper game.",0,0,en
"I never played the original game so I can't comment on the ""director's cut"" but I simply found that this game wasn't my cup of tea. Frankly, I found it really boring! The pace of the game was extremely slow, both physically (the characters walk across the screens at an excruciatingly slow pace), and in terms of the puzzles.  It's mostly dialogue based rather than puzzle based; you spend the vast majority of the time chatting to the various characters rather than ""doing stuff"". It's obvious that a lot of effort has been put into the writing and the voice acting of the dialogue but I found much of it to be tedious, and again, slow paced. I kept finding myself clicking through it because I was reading it much faster than it was being spoken. I also found the main character George to be somewhat annoying! I guess that is part of the 'charm'? But just not for me I guess. If you enjoy lots of dialogue, and a rich story about old mysteries and conspiracies then it might be just what you are looking for, but be prepared to spend a lot of time with it. I put in around 11 hours, and only got about 70% of the way through. I couldn't bring myself to finish it!",0,0,en

"Do not recommend buy this game yet. Potentially the game is very good: gameplay, mechanics, overall crafting/pve/pvp system. The flaws though are overwhelming at all the end-game sides. Some of them include: 1. Hackers. Game is full of hackers. Game has no hack protection system so anyone is free to use them. Ubisoft does not report if they are banned at all, there is nothing you can do except writing a mail to ""general"" section and get no reply. 2. Crafting materials that dont drop. You can spend up to 6 hours with no progress on your itemization/craft materials. 3.

"It's not been easy to come to a final solution whether this review should be positive or negative.  First of all, I'd like to say that the game itself is really awesome. You get the real feel of combat with a good amount of realism and so on. Pros: - Catchy gameplay - Tons of different gamemodes (Community servers ect.) - Improving your skills takes time, but you learn as the time flies by. - Really fun with others Cons: Well, with all the pros being said, there's only one thing that makes me downvote this game. The DLCs. Yep, there are DLCs and there are many of them. With only the base game, I often find myself unable to use half the helicopters since I need the DLC for that, and the DLC for that. 3/4 of the weapons in the game are also DLC. You can, however, still use them, but your screen gets overlayed with notifications that you're using premium content. Call me cheap, but as a person with a fairly big collection of games on Steam, I feel like the DLCs for this game are too expensive.",0,0,en
"""Pay 39,95€ minimum to gain access to about 10% of content, while 60% of existing content most people found use of is wiped"" *From Bungie* The Destiny Content Vault (DCV) is a new content model being implemented in Year 4 of Destiny 2.  To create a sustainable ecosystem where the world can continue to evolve in exciting ways,  and where we can update the game more quickly,  each year we will cycle some destination and activity content out of the game (and into the DCV)  to make room for new experiences. Unvaulting starts in D2 Year 4, with the Cosmodrome coming back, as well as its three Strikes and the return of the Vault of Glass Raid. Summary:  We remove most game content (Game modes, planets etc.) with very little to non to replace/compensate for. We are planning on bringing back previous vaults, but that might/will be behind a paywall. Prior to Beyond Light, the game was at its very peak, it has now literally hit rock bottom.  New sub class and Europa is nice but it just isn't anywhere near enough to compensate for both paying a minimum 39,95€ for a very short campaign (which is noticeably rushed, especially mid to near the end)  and very few new weapons & armours, also 1 new class (Stasis). Game feels extremely claustrophobic (very few planets to go to and do activities). I'm also not going to bother bringing up the whole sunsetting weapons and such, just look it up. They're working on ""The Witch Queen"" for 2021 & ""LightFall"" 2022. Until then, according to Bungie there will be barely any new content brought to the table. So as of right now by the looks of it, this is the start of the end of Destiny 2. We can only wish they take these requests serious and listen to the Destiny Community.",0,0,en

"This game is just a bad game. It is very generic and gameplay wise it's not adding much to the fear franchise other than coop. The coop takes away the horror element. Then they added challenges which are constantly showing making the game feel arcadey. Completing challenges give you points and rank you up. Each rank adds more health, slomo, and other stuff. You do not choose these upgrades.          The signature slomo is back, and shooting enemies with ragdoll effects does satisfy. Each character have their own traits, with point man slomo, and fettle being able to possess enemies. Some of the level designs are fun but without much of a story to support the setting. The story is lackluster, with no memorable moments and side characters are barely part of the story other than the protagonist between stages, shown through cutscenes from flashbacks.          The multiplayer is just a zombie type mode. You and squad must survive hordes of enemy variety types. You also find salvage boxes with guns that you bring back to base to get new weapons.           Overall, this is just a very generic shooter. It does not add anything to fear story and takes away the horror by replacing it with minor jump scares which you can casually miss",0,0,en

"Far Cry New Dawn is essentially a two-faced attempt at regaining some of the momentum Far Cry 5 garnered, combined with an attempt at leeching some of the popularity from the style and UI/HUD layout of Borderlands 2. While the gameworld is absolutely beautiful, the rest of the game is largely awkward and not at all immersive. Unlike Far Cry 5's semi-realistic take on firefights, New Dawn has thrown that out of the window and has replaced it with the healthbar design, as well as 'color-coded rankings' (i.e blue is rare, purple is epic, orange is legendary etc.). Weapons, NPCs, vehicles, quests, it's everywhere. And you can forget customization; Unlike Far Cry 5's delightful, if somewhat shallow customization options, Far Cry New Dawn has entirely done away with this, and instead opted for a janky, simplistic and altogether unwanted crafting system, which enables you to one-time craft a weapon you want, and afterwards have it available to you henceforth. No scopes, no silencers, nothing. Stealth weapons seem to be largely controlled by the aptly named 'Stealth' category of weapons, which seem to be predominantly consisting of crafted weapons reminiscent of the very ugly 'pipe gun' puzzlepiece design from Fallout 4. The voice acting is terrible, the world is empty, the antagonists are shallow, uninspired, and altogether neutered in terms of badassery. They're predictable and cookie-cutter; mary sues of the villain library of video games. They're there more as a means to an end, than an actual, identifiable menace. Unlike Joseph and his family in Far Cry 5, the twins of New Dawn's Highwaymen are nothing short of edgelord children, listening to Die Antwoord in their brightly colored bubble-gum-punk designed fortresses. They have no real goals or motivations beyond some delusional, brainwashed ideals of 'Problem-solvers and problem-makers' ingrained in their heads from their dad. Long story short; they are rebelious, socially inept emo-twins with daddy issues. Impossible to respect, impossible to identify with, and fundamentally impossible to take seriously. It ruins my entire interest in playing the game since the motivation of stopping the madman from Far Cry 5 is all but gone. Honestly, I dare say Far Cry New Dawn is not even a proper Far Cry game...More a money-grabbing afterthought from Ubisoft, in enamored hope that we'll drain our bank accounts just a tiii!iiiiny bit more so they can go fund more porn artists on Patreon or whatever they do with all that money they have. One thing's for sure; it's *NOT* going into video game development anymore. This game proves that.",0,0,en

"The hardest thing to write is a good comedy. The easiest thing to write is a bad comedy. The Dungeon of Naheulbeuk: The Amulet of Chaos is the latter. It is a silly, satire-focused CRPG that does exceedingly little to separate itself from contemporaries, save its almost supernatural ability to make the player cringe at every unabashedly unfunny moment of it.  In the beginning, it’s easy to be lulled into thinking the game is going somewhere. There’s a casual charm to it. The exposition is fine. The environments are better. The combat is unoriginal, but it’s still that standard turn-based tactics style that consumers have been gobbling up for years. And even the bubbly cadence with which the characters converse, perhaps only at first, doesn’t ring any alarm bells. Then Dungeon of Naheulbeuk attempts to tell a joke. Then another. Then another. Then another. Dungeon of Naheulbeuk is absolutely inundated with bad dialogue. This is a major problem because nearly half of the game is spent in either a cut scene, where the player is forced to listen to this atrocious back-and-forth among the characters, or in a battle (at about a 50/50 clip) where it is also pumped out with frightening regularity. With that much time dedicated to its writing and plot, it would be negligent not to alert a potential player coming here to experience a good story that they should sprint as hard as they can in the opposite direction. The story, in lieu of telling one, is much more interested in creating a hellscape in which the player is damned to live out eternity (20 hours) watching seven bad comedians try to top each other's handicapped wit. Like. We get it, the barbarian’s feet smell because he’s a barbarian and he’s stinky. We get it, the elf has big boobs and is completely naive to the fact that every male party member wants to experience them. You don’t have to keep jamming into the script—everywhere the stupid declarations might fit—that the barbarian is likely suffering from a fungal infection, or that the elf’s mammaries are ample. Aside from being completely unoriginal (unoriginal by design, as each character is purposefully a trope), there’s nothing funny about any of it. Dungeon of Naheulbeuk is like an etiquette test that quizzes adolescents on whether they’ve reached an acceptable level of maturity for public consumption. With one of the main questions being, At what point are you old enough to stop finding stinky feet and large breasts, without a punchline or context, funny? Now, what if I say it 50 to 100 times, what then? What if I never, ever stop saying it?   As this massive fart-joke-on-steroids takes center stage, it quickly and irreversibly pulls focus from every potentially positive moment of the experience. There’s actually some decent content buried here. But as the deluge of indulgently bad dialogue continues, that decent content becomes harder and harder to distinguish. Eventually all you notice is tons of shockingly bad humor. So, strap in for bad jokes! And repeated bad jokes! And cringey jokes! And, my personal favorite, completely illogical jokes(!) like this winner: “[This situation] is worse than kissing an albino pony.”  Good one, fellas; because everyone can relate to that! I’ve spent most of my adult life enjoying turned-based combat games. As video game genres go, and specifically as an RPG staple, they’ve become difficult to avoid. There’s a canonized formula to how the action unfolding in combat situations is built to work. And this game is mostly the same. You will control your party of seven (or eight if you so choose at one point) characters that all come with their own set of unique attributes and skills to use in combat. And I will give Dungeon of Naheulbeuk a lot of credit in this regard. The combat works, looks, and feels good. However, I don’t trust the RNG.    After a severely inordinate amount of “Critical Fails” that were sending my fired arrows back into my own characters’ faces, I furiously decided to reload a Save. Upon reloading, I tried the same move—and I got the same result, critical failure. So, I tried it again; the same result continued. Then I decided to try other moves. I was shocked to find that no matter what move I attempted (an attack, a heal, or a buff), I was destined to critically fail. And because the game does a poor job of differentiating between the enemies, the spells or attacks you elect to use are even more important than they usually are in battle. You really can’t waste a move, as there’s no great way of telling which of all the different spells your foes will be resistant to, or what they have at their own disposal to counter you with.  In other words, no matter how accidentally appropriate my input was for the given situation, it was always going to fail. My choice never mattered. How can you critically fail a roll that never happened?  If reloading is cheating, so too are loaded dice.  The aesthetics (which you might notice when the game avoids talking for longer than a minute) are quite nice. The environments through which the party travels fit nicely within the pantheon of fantasy dungeons. Expect the usual suspects. There are plenty of rats, spiders, orcs, and goblins to kill. And even if some of it is undoubtedly hackneyed, the game still does a respectable job of creating a world that makes sense in a fantasyverse.   As a bonus, there’s a tavern enhanced by appropriate music. It’s frankly the only part of the game I’d recommend playing un-muted. It’s a charming respite from the misadventures (and abhorrent literary composition) awaiting outside its doors.  Somewhere here, buried deep inside, is a decent turn-based tactics game, which I enjoyed at first. However, what slowly cocooned around the core was a hardened tumor that prevented any decent idea from flourishing. Each continuing hour of the game was another hour spent in a realm of tit jokes, fourth-wall breaks, and poorly utilized pop-culture references. And the more they came, the more my contempt grew. A boss late in the game describes the entire setting as a “s****y dungeon” in an attempt to be funny. It was, ironically, the first time the game made me laugh.  I bet you can guess why.",0,0,en

"Edit on January 2018: Performance problems were never fixed on my end, devmode is still enabled no matter what, had to uninstall because I just don't think it's worth it any more. Really sad about this game. BEWARE SPOILERS!! My take on this game comes from two different places I wanna adress, but before that, keep in mind I -liked- the game, but as much as it pains me, I cannot recommend this title by any means unless it's on a big discount, or the current problems as of the day of this review are fixed. Having played through the main campaing AND having tried the Freedom Chronicles, I feel confident enough to say that The New Colossus is an unfinished game that needed more time. I will try to keep this simple, might edit stuff later. As a reference, here's my current rig: GTX 970, I7 4790k, 16gb RAM, 1920x1080 60Hz, with the last Nvidia driver, the 388.00 version. Performance: -On release day, game crashed when alt tabbing, when changing resolutions, got a couple BSODS while playing. -Game couldn't handle 1920x1080, as there was a configuration error with the DPI scaling  -Game worked pretty stable on Ultra, 60 fps and that, but anything beyond that had mayor FPS drop rates, which might be because my current GPU can't handle Uber (GTX 970). Some levels at the beginning were badly optimized -Game constantly corrupted my data, was unable to sync with the cloud, for some reason it doesn't detects the console 100% of the times, and because of that, you can't access your game profile, because it needs to be linked with your cloud. This happened a couple of times, and I believe is something that the developers should look at, if they're listening to the feedback at all. The Game: Story wise, I got pretty hooked on it from the beggining, it felt fresh and new, and I absolutely loved the character interactions and flavor between the npcs, it felt like a nice touch, with much more richer storytelling than New Order. It's the same ''blazko go blow this ♥♥♥♥ up'' kind of momentum that NewOrder has. The game abruptely ends on what seemed to be the middle of the story, the finale lacking an end boss, and Blazko taking revenge on Frau Engel. The game offers the same beautiful shooting mechanics as NWO, and the game looks beautiful, but it's very, very short. It feels like a story was trying to be told, with cinematics every level, a backstory for Blazko, new characters, a definitive change of pace, but it doesn't feels like Wolfenstein, feels like something ELSE, and I think, had there been more time to add more content to the game, I wouldn't think that. It feels like watching a movie, one I really liked, but it doesn't feels like a complete shooter. Perks have changed completely, and some of them are almost useless in the game. In new order, it defined your playstyle, and it felt intuitive and natural to understand. Those features feel like achievements in The New Colossus, some of them are useful, some are not. There are weapon upgrades now, for every weapon that you own, except for the heavy weapons. These upgrades are almost MANDATORY to finish the game, especially if you're playing on Uber/Death Incarnate. Takedowns have stayed mostly the same, but the stealth on this game is UNFORGIVING. Some could say this is more realistic and challenging, I honestly don't know what they did to the stealth, but sometimes it doesn't makes sense, as enemies can see you even if you're hidden. When you finish the game, you can keep playing, and you get to hunt down Uberkommanders, visit locations, and get collectibles. If these were added into the main story, the game would had been very different. They're not a hassle, but story doesn't advances much after that.  Now, on the DLCS. Freedom chronicles comes with the preorder of the game, and it features mini stories for 3 different characters, each with different abilities and levels made for them. It also comes with combat simulations, something like challenge levels if you wanna play those. By the looks of it, it seems like this is scheduled to be released over time, to add content of the game. I don't mind having more content, (as the game on itself it's lacking some), but it makes you think why wasn't Freedom Chronicles a part of the main game. Overall, it feels like this game needed more time. Crashes and performance issues on release day, and well after WEEKS these problems keep happening. There is a huge problem with the in-game content, it really feels like Machinegames added features at the end of the game to give it some more lifespan, added with Freedom Chronicles and combat simulations. I cannot recommend this game, as much as I wanted to. Performance issues NEED TO BE FIXED, it is unacceptable that after 15 days since the game was released (currently at the time of this review), it seems like there's nothing going on to adress those issues. The new take on Wolfenstein is great, New Order was a gem, and The New Collosus brings new, interesting stuff to the table, and I'd love to keep playing and see what comes out of this story, but a broken game is still a broken game. Get this on discount, or don't get it at all, and expect things to break if you do. I will gladly change and modify this review over time if stuff changes, as for the moment, it's a toothless wolf that's stuggling to walk.",0,0,en

"I have played Spec Ops: The Line for ~20 hours, and I have gotten all 50 achievements. Here is my list of pros and cons regarding the game. Fairly easy achievements (with dedication) Good colors Skippable cutscenes Horrific checkpoint system that makes the game an incredibly boring grind on harder difficulties Terrible and incompetent AI Bad sprinting system Plot that makes you think you have some control, but all paths are scripted to lead to the same stupid edgy ending Ammo capped too low. When on harder difficulties it takes a whole clip for a single enemy, might as well give us a higher ammo maximum... This game was mediocre. 6/10 for achievement difficulty because of FUBAR one shot deaths, decent scenery at some points, but overused purple colors and sun flares. If you like scripted third person shooters (with chunky cover mechanics) that horribly attempt to convey a psychological breakdown in the protagonist, this game is perfect for you. If you like a game where the choices you make actually change the outcome, like in the Walking Dead, and there are checkpoints every couple minutes so that you don't have to grind through the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover shooting battles over and over again, then I recommend getting something else.",0,0,en

"Wtf is this? And before you get mad yes i understand it was made by a small team of 5 and the game was supose to be only for backers but let me tell u what i think. First off this game raised 108,000 dollars which is an amazing amount. And this game has been in development for 5 years. What have they been doing this whole time? Because what they wanted the ""Backers"" to test after 5 long years with 108,000 dollars is literally nothing. This game seems like it was made within a year and not 5 years xD. And for people who argue that this was only for ""Backers"" is a total joke xD. If i backed this and waited 5 years and finally got to play it and it was...... this than i would be super pissed. I get it its a very early build but still after all this time at least give us something playable. Something we can have fun with and give good feedback. You can literally do NOTHING in this game but walk around and collect wood. How can backers be okay with this? How can this be defended? I am refunding the game and will get it again when its playable and an actual game. And dont say that I should make a game and see how it feels, ive played dozens of survival games that were a thousand times better earlier release and by teams just as small or smaller. And yes i know they warned people there would be alot of issues and bugs but didnt warn that the game would be unplayable and have literally none of the features they promised. If your a backer or fanboy and your still defeneding this crap than your fooling yourself. I honestly do hope this game turns into a masterpiece later on but as of right now its laughably unforgiving.",0,1,en
"Blood Alloy is definitely an enjoyable game, but it just doesn't have enough content to warrant a purchase. I have only played 20 minutes of the game thus far but I already feel like i've seen everything the game has to offer. Blood Alloys combat and movement is it's biggest strength. Movement is very fluid in it's simplest state. You then also have the abilities of dashing and double jumping which make moving around the map and avoiding enemies very enjoyable. Combat involves use of the mouse to aim and shoot enemies. You also have a jump dash ability to attack enemies. These movements and combat made a very enjoyable survival experience.  Enemy variety is very good as well. They increase in difficulty to kill as you progress. It turns into a kinda bullet hell type game later as a lot of enemies and they fire in different patterns. Enemies are very enjoyable to kill and require some skill to avoid there fire while also attacking them. Aesthetically the graphics are rather pleasing. It presents it's self in a nice looking fashion that isn't too complex graphics but is still satisfying to look at. Animations are very nice looking too. The soundtrack goes along great with the gameplay. Blood Alloy is a survival game at it's heart. No real levels exist aside from different asthetics and slightly different layouts. So really it's a score attack game to see if you can survive as long as possible. This I would be happy with, but there is a huge problem. There is no real motivation to get a higher score. No unlocks exist as far as I can tell from my current progress. They also don't have an online leaderboard system. The game doesn't even have achievements. It feels like they rushed the release and felt this was a low priority to add. However a score attack game is not fun unless you have a reason to get a higher score.  I really did enjoy my short time playing blood alloy. However it has very little reason to replay it. Therefore 20 minutes is as much enjoyable time I got out of it. So until there is some kind of reason for me to play more of it but into the game i'm afraid I cannot recommend you to purchase this.

"No mans sky is clearly a work that came from a passionate team. As the care it has recieved has been outstanding, compared to other games. As i have't played a lot it would be unfair to rate the entire gameplay. So i'll stick to the first couple of hours. The overall gameplay in the beginning is fairly good, providing great content that i wish to contiune to explore in the future, the gameplay is fairly  paced in the beginning but it feels like the grind begins to pickup after 1-2hrs of play. The grind however can be a bit tedius and feel uninteresting. An other grudge i have is the fact that you constantly have to recharge all your stuff. Each tool with a different material. This turns your grind into more of ""Grind to stay alive and refill every  tool all the time"" and less ""Grind to gather materials to build a house, upgrade tools etc."" This could be made better by lowering the resource consumption of certains tools. Maybe make your player tools use one material and your ship tools use another. My last minor grudge is the ship controls. I'm personally not really a fan of these unresponsive controls. The ships feels like it is lagging behind my movement. If you judge the game purely based on gameplay alone you have a solid 7/10. Good fun with mild annoyance. I would love if i could give it that high of a score but  multiple major flaws still exist that make me want to turn this game off after 30 min. first one is the UI and the way you interact with it. The UI feels like a console port that were just ripped straight from the console verson and stitched onto the pc port. I dont get why i have to hold the button to do even the simplest tasks such as opening inventorys. i can't it just be one click.The games seems to lack the ability to use your scrollwheel, instead of scrolling through a menu with your scrollwheel you click side buttons. Really annoying in my opinion. And to top that off, the worst part of the UI is when changing numbers on the menu, this includes volume, mouse sensitivity, station trading and buying.  Seriosly why do i have to hold a button for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fortnight to set my volume to 100 or sell exactly 50 items. One of my last major issue is the performance on this game is abismal. This is to my record the worst running game i've ever played, making the PUBG Beta look butter smooth compared to this molested donkey. There is however some configs you can make inside the gamefiles to increase your performance but it still runs like as fast as a walrus.  I currently own a GTX 970 (compareable to GTX 1060) and 4790K, both good mid-range components that should be capable of running this game at Medium settings 1080p 60fps.  1080p 60fps is as a long stretsh compared to what i actually get, if i get lucky i can hit 60 fps on the lowest settings possible in 1080p. it mostly stays around 40-50fps with drops into the 30s. In all other space games i've played i get upto 3x that performance. This performance is unacceptable for this hardware and will be the result to a  point for 2 being deducted. Small issues i also have is the inability to disable view-bobbing. Whilst not a huge problem for most people, if you suffer from motion sickness you may want to hold off on you purchase. I were so close to give this game a positive rating. However the performance issues and motion sickness pulled me of that idea. Overall a game with huge potential with a great amount of gameplay that i will return to once a couple more updates hits with performance issues. And will update score accordingly. However currently i am giving it:",0,0,en

The fighting part becomes harder and boring but if you exploit jump+kick you can kill fast anything. The interesting part is some parkour, very similar to the gameplay from Mirror's Edge.

"Quite the downgrade compared to the previous installment, Crimes and Punishment. This game barely scratches that detective itch. Riddled with uninteresting QTE and minigames. Riddled with time-consuming puzzles who are not at all relevant to the crime or are unnecessary. (Having to go through imaginary temples with superstitious traps, getting from point A to B with wacky contraptions, heck the minigames being Shoe-polishing, Chimney cleaning, Roof-Parkour... all of these unnecessary minigames just to tail a suspect, should honestly be skippable) Now this wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the massive performance downgrade, the game's nothing revolutionary graphic wise, and not much of a upgrade from the predecessor. But somehow, just somehow it runs like god awful. At first it would run nicely, but as you play for say, nearly an hour or more, the games performance stagnates to micro-freezes, stutters, constant low framerate, which makes the already annoying QTE minigames more annoying and thus frustating. I am not sure if it's some memory-leak or whatever, some others state it's Denuvo at work. Either way it's apparently been a issue for a long time. How bad is it? well even if you can run Arma III, GTA V or MonsterHunter:World or Shadow of War at max, show caution because this game apparently does not give a damn with it's surprisingly stale performance for a Unrealgame. TL;DR if you're looking to scratch that Detective itch, go for Crimes and Punishment instead.",0,0,en
"First off, I really, REALLY wanted to like & recommend this game. I heard about this series from a friend & it sounded fun & interesting, & iirc it was on consoles at 1 point or another but I missed out on picking the console versions. That being said I thought I'd give the Steam version a whirl. Th problem is - and it's a huge problem - I just can't get the damn game to launch, PERIOD. No matter what troubleshooting I did, I couldn't get the issue resolved, & from what I can gather (based on the game's forums), the game is a steamy, glitchy mess.

"If you want to enjoy this game quit reading any reviews and don't look at any videos. If you didn't - go buy this game at 80% off and enjoy a few hours of this very original little piece of art. However I can't recomment this game as a ... game. Especially not at full Price. Gameplay is on a mobile game level. A lot of waiting is involved, those workstation upgrades and everything is for me annoying. Simply watching someone else playing the game (with the waiting part cut out) would be better. How saving is being handled is also annoying. The game saves namely at the end of the night. So If you play in small chunks of time it's very annoying, and every time you have to quit you have to start the day from the beginning.

"Devil's Hunt is a 3D hack n' slash action game where you play as Desmond, an underground boxer and the son of a wealthy CEO. Betrayed by his friend and almost losing everything overnight, he chose to end his own life and found himself in hell. There, he met Lucifer and formed a pact with him, becoming an executor. The game features a hack n' slash combat system which seems to be unpolished still. The combat is overall unsatisfying as most of the time when you attack enemies, it doesn't feel like you're actually hitting them as there's a visible lack of impact and the enemies don't even flinch most of the time when you hit them. The game also offers several combo systems and three skill trees for you to advance from, however as time goes by in the game, you'll find yourself not relying on the skills and combo system but key-mashing instead, making combat boring and monotonous. Overall, the combat system just feels clunky, from the lack of feedback when attacking an enemy to skills missing due to a bad targeting system, it just doesn't feel enjoyable at all. Also, the game still requires some serious optimization work as I experienced many FPS drops and lag spikes throughout the game in specific areas of the game, while most areas I explored in the game run completely smooth. However, the game offers a very well-designed environment which is very pleasing to the eye. From the different landscapes to the stunning visual effects, travelling through both Hell and Earth has been really enjoyable. You can see how much work the developer has put into designing each and single area down to the smallest details. Also, the sound effects used throughout the game greatly complement the well-designed environment and the narration put into each character are really well-made too. Besides the environment design and the sound of the game, the one thing that kept me captivated the most was the story of the game. There are times I just wanted to stop playing the game due to the bad combat system, however, what kept me going was the story. Every time I felt like giving up on the game, I would ask myself, what's going to happen next in the story and that kept me going until I completed the game. The game has many cutscenes throughout the game that aren't too lengthy and are well-placed to fit the pace of the game. Overall, Devil's Hunt is a game that could've been so much more but suffers due to a poorly executed combat system and optimization issues. For 4-5 hours of gameplay and at its current price point, I'd not recommend the game as there are so much better titles you could get at this price that you'd probably enjoy much more than Devil's Hunt. However, if you're a fan of the hack n' slash genre, you should give this game a try if it ever goes on sale.",0,0,en

"Man of Medan had the potential to be a great horror game, considering its setup but, unfortunately, it fails completely on all aspects of the genre. 👍  +Lighting and textures are high quality. 👎 -Cheap scare simulator. -Horrible voice acting. -The plot starts interesting but goes to ♥♥♥♥ once you figure it out. The story starts simple and good enough, a ship that carries soldier coffins and some mysterious boxes is stranded in the middle of the ocean when a storm hits it and it unleashes what was in the mysterious sealed boxes and everyone onboard start to see things which quickly turns into a horror show.  Fast forward years later the main characters are introduced and they go on a boat trip to scuba dive in the ocean and find the location of the Manchurian gold. As you slowly progress through pointless nonsensical writing, things start to go wrong and end up on the ship Medan. As you can imagine things take a terrible turn and based on ur stupid choices characters may die or not. You start to realize what goes on on the ship and once you figure out things, the horror aspect just goes poof in the air.  I honestly just want to tell you what happens to avoid you the pain but I don't like to spoil things but don't expect anything good.  And just how it ends the post ending scenes are even more stupid than the rest of the game.  If you do want to know the main plot here's the gist of it, huge spoilers ahead:  Story rating: 6/10 So the plot is bad, maybe the gameplay can carry it right? It does not. Ever played walking simulators or Telltale games? Well cut half the gameplay, make the movement slower and you have Man of Medan.  You walk so little and in the most obstructed mega linear paths that I can't even call it a walking simulator. There are some good aspects and some choices you make matter on who survives or not but most of them are just nonsensical. For example, I found a gas mask and the character never used it and just discarded completely. Another character found a knife and she lost it later in the water, never using it. Maybe there were scenes and choices that could've led to me using them? Probably yes, probably not, but the way it was managed was deplorable, to say the least.  There are some dialogue choices in the game and how you respond it increases your reputation with the characters you speak with or can change your traits. What do these stats and traits do? Not sure. At least they did nothing in my playthrough or at least I felt they did nothing. My characters did not build any relation with one another even though I was nice because the game forced you anyway in dumb situations so what was the point of them? Achievements? Maybe it affects certain scenes? Unknown but does not really matter since if you fail a QTE your characters can and will die, in the stupidest ways. I managed to only get one character killed right before the end only because I got so bored I just stopped paying attention.  How can you add such interesting features that can alter the course of the story, presumably, alongside the most boring gameplay aspects of all time? What and who was behind this decision? Until Dawn had the same mechanics but they emphasized the importance of them throughout the game and the situations made sense. The same company made those games but I doubt the same people worked on both games. I feel like the engine was simply given to a small team and told them to deal with it.  But is it scary? Well if you find cheap scare mechanics scary than I suppose it will be for you because that's what all the game does to frighten you. It puts you in a zoomed-in scene and then just pops something in your face. That's what the developers thought a horror game should be. Think about that.  Gameplay rating: 5/10 Horror games and sound design should always work in perfect harmony. You cannot have a good horror game with bad sound design and Man of Medan has one of the worst sound mixes I've ever heard. From the first minute you start the game you'll notice the voice acting is bad which carries the entire game but not only that the sound effects from the ship and whatnot are so loud you can't even hear the voices of the soldiers. Muffled and poor quality sound effects and cheap recording becomes frustrating. Later in the game, it gets a bit better but at that point, you just won't care or even pay attention anymore. There's no fluidity to how characters talk to one another, one moment they're chill with you than the other they're mad, robotic.  As for the soundtrack, I suppose the few songs present in the game are okay. You won't care much about that anyway.  Audio rating: 5/10 So does the game run well at least? Thankfully it does but it's not an impressive feat because while it has great assets such as detailed textures and impressive lighting, it also looks boring as hell and devoid of details. You are in extremely tight spaces all the time so naturally, it should run perfectly.  Level design is absolutely bad as I mentioned in the gameplay aspect, painfully linear without almost any exploration paths whatsoever on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ huge navy ship. So much potential wasted.  As for bugs, no issues whatsoever.  Graphics, performance and tech analysis score:  6.5/10 So do I recommend Man of Medan? Hell no. Stay away from this terrible game.

"Such a disappointment to be honest. Especially after I loved both DOW and DOW2 (minus the Retribution - It's campaign was meh and they got rid of my fav Force Commander Hairgel). * Design: Everything looks like a friggin' plastic, you are being blinded every second by way too much special effects, yet don't see any blood whatsoever. Still prefer Space Marines from DOW2 and SpaceMarine games, where their proportions seem to be appropriate for a genetically enhanced human. * Gameplay: Only 3 races? Really? Even DOW2 had 4 of the on the release. It's not like you have to change the core mechanics of each race with each installment. Balance changes or a few newer units - yeah you could do that. StarCraft sends its regards btw. I also hate how Relic have removed unit upgrade system known by previous games in the series as weel as COH games. Each squad felt mor specialized and had a more personal approach.  Anime-Angelos (with changed VA for no reason. Old one was badass.) - if you want to use a Terminator Armor with melee weapon - get your friggin' teleporter. It's a tactical dreadnaught armor, not some flying eldar-xenos-nonsence. Yes, btw, the modes are really lacking. just a few bland and uninspired maps for a whole game. * Story: Do I really need to speak about this? Campaign is literally a tutorial for the multiplayer, that lacks any of its own features. And btw, why would you need any tutorial here? Game is easy as hell.  Ah, right, they also removed Co-op mode, that was great in DOW2 (IMHO), so don't expect any variety in campaign. Even Last Stand in DOW2 has more depth. 4/10 - the worst WH40K game I got to play.

Is just one of those countless games people make in browsers, but this one can be completed in under 10 minutes and it spams you tons of achievements even upon just booting the game, probably to prevent you from refunding the game.

Which is a big problem because when it comes to these games, you are pretty much buying them for the art, so when the art looks like that is like ""... eh?"" you know? And talking about art. This game only has 6 artworks/levels (the ones you see on the store page). And apart from being jaggy and blurry, the ""dev"" also traced and recolored them from other artists. The most noticeable of these recolors is the shark Nika in the front page of the game. As those huge eyes are pretty much ""MacMegaGERC"" signature at this point. Just look at the original one and compare it with the one in the store page:   Yeah, because flipping the image and changing the color sure is making ""original art"" as the dev says.",0,0,en

"Game is really fun but not a game worth 55€ There's a really big lack of a content for this price. Of course there's a lot of content coming in in dlcs which is really stupid IMO, you already paid a lot and you would have to pay a lot more for some more decent content. Also i really like the Dirt 4 career mode and i think it wouldn't be bad to actually have some career mode here instead of just driving for some random team or just blank car. I get that it's supposed to be a sim, but someone can find it being boring after the first two championships. PROS (using gamepad)  - It's fun to drive  - I like the handling even though it seems that it's really easier than DR 1  - Track degradation and the ability to change the type of tyres.  - Sounds   CONS  - You have to be all-time online to play career mode.  - Car and track selection is really small, definitely not worthy of this price.  - DLCS (There's a lot to come)  - The pace notes are bad, the co-driver sounds like he's not sitting in a racing car driving 150 km/h on dirt roads.  - It seems that sometimes it struggles with the performance.  - No steam cards.  - The contrast and saturation seems really wiggly. Sometimes it's too dark for some reason and seconds later you will need sunglasses to even see anything. Not a con really but there's no Hillclimb or buggies.  Overall DiRT Rally 2.0 isn't a bad game. It's definitely an upgrade to it's predecessor DiRT Rally, but it really could've been better. I'm kinda feeling bad for downvoting the game because it's good but it just lacks. EDIT: Not feeling bad anymore for downvoting the game, regret buying this game so much. ALOT OF DLCS",0,0,en

"First of all - I don't actively dislike this game. It's alright at what it is - at least there are no bugs and it functions well. Problem is, it doesn't offer much, especially for it's normal price. There are 6 long stages, that you complete not by killing every enemy or surviving long enough, but by collecting certain resource that randomly flies around. There is a balance to this mechanic - the longer you take, the more upgrades you can collect and the easier next waves will be. But, obviously, if you lose, you waste more time. And I'd actually recommend this game if: a) Stages had more than 1 objective - collecting those 6-10 things per wave, 10 waves per stage, 6 stages. b) Bosses were at least a tiny bit more interesting - each one has only 2 phases, very unoriginal patterns and naturally, there are no different ways of defeating those. c) Environments would change at least a little bit more, showing different sceneries, not just different colours of space. There is also a bit odd system of upgrades - for example if you collect shields and then collect EMP bomb, it will destroy enemies, but also destroy my own shields. But that is actually not a bad thing, since it creates risk/reward system. Same cannot be said for weapon upgrades (of which there are only 3) that drop randomly in limited amounts at every wave, and level weapons separately from level 1 to max 10 (resetting to 1 at the end of every stage, but you can make one of those weapons start at level 2-4 later). Problem is, if you go for only 1 type of weapon from the start of the stage, you'll have to dodge other types for the rest of the level, because when you pick up another weapon type, you won't be able to switch until you pick up previous weapon - and for a time you'll have level 2 weapon, instead of possible level 10. Plus, the whole idea of getting upgrades that often and for no reason seems a bit silly to me, for games of this type usually upgrades are hidden either in specific places, or rewarded for killing specific enemies or groups of enemies - or at the very least you can switch weapons whenever you want, so you don't have to actively dodge upgrades. And last bad thing - game does not look particularly good. But it's subjective, so it's my last negative point :) But there are good things too - at least they would be if things above were different. Most importantly - game does not make you remember patterns of enemy spawns, they spawn pretty much randomly - and you have to react to them accordingly. This is different from most Shoot'em'ups, where learning > reacting. And I'll be honest, seeing more of ""reacting"" type of gameplay would be nice. Experience system is kinda nice too, the only problem, is that there are 2 ways of getting exp - through achievements (which can be considered quests, for example killing 1000 of certain type of enemy), and through random drops - and as I said above, it's not a good thing, giving random rewards like that. So this gets half a point. If it was relying only on quests and not random things, i'd give it a full point :) So.. I'm sorry to say, this game needs severe redeveloping to be worthy of it's current price. Even with big discount it's quite a dull and not particularly well balanced experience. And I doubt, it will ever see such an improvement. Therefore, I cannot recommed it.",0,0,en

"Getting proposed to by a complete stranger is just another day in the life of being a princess. This game is cute and fun but very short. I got through the whole thing in about an hour and replayed several times for various romantic endings. The artwork is creative and the card game contains cards that remind me of the Princess Maker series. The card game is simple but very much dependant on luck. I just wish there was more to the game, even with going back and unlocking different endings, the card tournament just felt really short. Needs more story. It's a lot of $$ to pay for a game that feels really short and lacking in story and card game play. There's some replay value (if you want to unlock all the endings).

"Dark Places is the third game in the ""Old Blood"" game series. Don't worry, none of the game are actually connected, but simply made by the same Dev, all using the infamous ""FPS Creator Engine."" Now, compared to the first game   Dark Places is a big step up. In terms of the other game,   this takes a couple steps back. Let's start with the good. The atmosphere in this game is top notch! They have the horror vibe pretty much covered! The levels are dark, maybe a bit too dark in some places, and the music/audio fit great! Though most of the spooky sounds are all in the music, so it's pretty empty in terms of sounds. Most levels have great design and layouts that make it fun to play through. Weapons are decent, even if there is only 3. I will say the shotgun is very good! Even if it can only hold 4 shots, but it can kill just about everything in just a few shots. And that's all the good I can really say. Dark Places has some issues that just sadly suck the fun out of it. As is with the last 2 games, because it's on the FPSC Engine, it's got problems. Hitboxes are dodgy at best, clipping into walls, framerate stutters, long load times, game can crash when saving, and the enemy AI is bad. By far the worst parts of the game is when you are trying to ""parkour"" in some levels to reach doors/switches to progress. The movement in the FPSC engine is just always so so bad, so doing these sections are never fun. I mentioned that some levels are a little too dark, well you have to blindly walk in some dark areas, even rubbing up against walls to find the next hallway because they are so dark. There is little lanterns you can pick up and carry with you to light up the way a little bit, except not every level has them, or you can get lucky and have the lantern clip through the floor and lose it! I even managed to glitch the game and get the game to use the ""duel wield"" ability, even if the game didn't intent for it to be used. (The duel wielding is from the modded FPSC engine.) So I made my left hand carry the weapon, then I could pick up the lantern and still keep my gun out. You know what's even more fun? When the game strips your weapons away and makes you run through a maze with monsters to find door switches. The game does this TWICE!! Both times are NOT fun! The first time this happens is pretty easy, but the second time it will spawn in more monsters because it will give you some of your weapons back, but you are so greatly out numbered in this level, that you can not fight them and have to run. The monsters? Oh man, some of them are complete bull. There is some monsters that will take a weapons entire clip to kill, which you happen to fight against more than one at a time. How about a monster that shoots a pump action shotgun like it's a machine gun?  Or how about the monster that can hit you from ANYWHERE in the map even through walls just for being active. This game also likes to spawn enemies behind you, and quite often. Pretty much the entire time I played, the only times it ""scared me"" was it would spawn an enemy behind me and it attacked me with no notice that it was behind me. Quite cheap, though thankfully there is no jumpscares in this game. Oh and the final boss fight is just terrible! The actual boss enemy itself isn't terrible, it's the map you are fighting on is what makes it terrible! In the little arena you are fighting in, there is some blood splatters on the floor, some you can see easy and some not so easy, that if you step on them, you get teleported to a spot in the arena that deals damage to you for every second you stand in it. The best part, the Devs knew this was going to be an issue, so they give you 999 health points! No ammo in the map, and no health pickups either. Is the game perfect? God no. Did I have fun? Yeah in some parts I was having some great fun, but a good chunk of the game I was not having fun. The not fun parkour levels, the cheap enemies, and just too dark and god awful maze level really were not fun to play through. If you are someone that's maybe curious and want to give it a shot, wait for a sale. Even though I'm giving the game a thumbs down, it's actually right in the middle, and Steam doesn't give that option in reviews. In terms of a FPSC game, it's good, but not as good as DOOMED... And waaaaaay better than CRIMSON METAL. Also, on the store page the Devs put:  ""• Puzzles - show your demons in the review section if you are not attentive to details and don't like to read notes that have tips for solving the puzzles.""

"there is a big difference between difficulty and frustration, this game is the later. 1- warren is slow, cluncky and unresponsive, even if you use the fastest armor and weapons there is still lag. 2- hit detection is not perfect, specially with duel wield weapons, its just sick how the dual wielding enemies seem to be able to hit you even if you think you are far enough and dodging them is so hit and miss; while u cant hit ♥♥♥♥ when u duel wield your self 3- speaking of dodging, developers seem fond of throwing ultra aggressive enemies at you in ultra tight corridors so dodging is almost impossible and blocking mechanic is all but useful in this game, whats more those enemies can kill you in 2-3 hits while you need 5-6 to do so, take about unfairness! 4- i dont want the game to hold my hand but i wanna at least know where should i go! no  objectives to tell you what to do next, not even a map! let alone points of interest or markers! this is only made worse by the fact that the game world is nothing but a huge maze, and to travel in it you either have to go all the long way again and fight all the frustrating enemies again or use the shortcuts, aaaah the shortcuts .... dont get me started again, just  read point 3 again! below review is useful:",0,0,en
"Hard to say whether this ""definitive"" edition is any better than the original one. There are plenty improvements and new content but also countless game-breaking issues and various annoyances that are too many to list, including random crashes with zero way to get back in the match. I hate leaving a bad review for what I hope will only be temporary problems because the game itself is good but currently it is barely playable. A recent update also completely botched scenarios and made them unplayable, patch after patch some things get fixed and others get royally fluked up.",0,0,en

"As much as I loved this game, I cannot recommend it as it is right now. The amount of glitches and bugs make this game almost unplayable. I could go on with specific examples such as many side quests, that are simply most of time frozen and you are stuck at the objective, which exists on the map but not in the world for some reason, like the bees and honey quest, which was mentioned on several forums since 2017 and nobody bothered to fix it. Motigene Gives You Wings freezes the character and you are unable to talk to him to complete the quest. Superb Meat Boy quest breaks through the last cutscene and therefore you are unable to complete it. You can even accidently fail a quest as you get attacked by people or characters are stuck inside the walls. Not mentioning the worst and most frustrating glitch I experienced half way through the first Act - save option being disabled. No matter what I did, restarting the game, killing myself/restarting the level, taking and completing quests, moving from one district to another, entering buildings etc the game did NOT allow me to manually save the progress. It did fortunatelly autosaved after completing the quests, but when I tried to exit the game, the message popped up saying that the game cannot be saved because the character is busy or something like that. Overall performance issues, unstable FPS, many technical problems, blurred textures, invisible obstacles, frozen animations, broken quests and game breaking issues. Sometimes the cutscene ends but the game doesn't detect it and you are stuck in the letterbox view with and not being able to move. It's a real shame, because the game has a big potential, great creepy atmosphere and beautiful detailed sceneries. If you like Fallout, Bioshock, Bendy and Ink Machine sort of games, you would love this game for sure! British themes and voice actings are amazing, and it's one of the reasons I kept playing this game. But let's face it, this is unaccaptable to sell broken and unfinished game for THAT price, this is just an insult to all gamers",0,0,en

"Well  it saddens me to write it but I think ""Strategic Command :World War 1 "" is a bit of a fizz.The previous ""Strategic Command Classic"" had 24 campaigns including such rare gems as the Balkans having a pop at the Ottomans,my lot ,the Anzacs trying it on with  Mustafa  Kemal , the Siege of Kut and a wee dust up called the Russian Civil war.

"I really wanted to like this game, but sadly it executes very poorly in gameplay. Please, spend your money on other Stealth/Assasin game, especially if you're a Fan of the genre. I personally love Stealth and Assassin games, but Alekhine's Gun just didn't work well for me. I watched Walktroughs and Playtroughs on YouTube before trying out this game and I thought it looked interesting enough to give it a try. Now, the second reason I'm giving this game a thumbs down is because that way I can refund my money and spend it on a better game.  * Super cool ''James Bond'' feeling to the game * Overall very simple and first mission was quite easy getting done. * Whistle for distracting an enemy. - Punching an enemy was cool, but how in the world is this going to be useful both after and before you alerted anyone? seems to always aggro even more enemies. * Large detailed maps, buildings and smooth getting around, BUT not so much content in terms of interracting with stuff. * Very odd transformation/flash on the Screen for 'weather' section as you step out/in from Outdoors and Indoors.  * No jumping system and the only way to Stealth kill an enemy is by crouching and then you gotta be fast to strangle him from behind. * Comically bad AI, bugs, and clumsy controls. * Bland characters and a story that delivers trough a wall of text. I'm not enjoying the cutscenes either.  * Horrible gun system. Sneaking and walking sounds are bad. There are no good effects whatsoever.  * Disguise System doesn't help for most of the times. * Game is crashing when you change Resolution.  Spend your money into other Stealth/Assassin games because there are loads of better ones available out there. Like I mentioned before, you can give it a try for an hour or two and then refund your money from Steam if you didn't like it :) This is pretty much a Poor Man's Hitman",0,0,en

"You know. This game has great potential. I bought it, when it was first advertised on steam. I'm  a dino lover, and I am indeed looking forward to yet see, a dino simulator which does the job.  I will keep it short. This game has been standing still for years, and I chose to support the devs by spending my money on this game. We've for many years seen no other playable dino than the first. The only playable dino plays exactly like it did in the start. (no change there), and the game is simply laggy as hell and nearly unenjoyable because of overpowered AI, AI stupidity and being able to run halfway through trees. Devs keep showing us their work in progress and log. Latest update being refining the bark on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tree. How about doing some hardcore refining on the game mechanics, AI and adding content that makes the game enjoyable. I remember when the Isle was dumb and bare boned. The way the Isle kept making the game interesting, was by refining and adding enjoyable elements to the game, such as new maps, scent,  and other playables.  I suggest the devs to make the player enable a map, so we get an idea of where we are going and so that you atleast could find your way through the map. If ya get lost, the fast draining og your food and water level will get you killed. This makes it impossible to explore. I'm getting all worked up about how this game is standing still with no interesting features, simply because it all feels like one big scam. Updates are also coming out so slow, that by the time the game will be enjoyable, no one would play it, because it will be outdated before it even came into existence. FFS.  DONT BUY. The devs recieved MANY THOUSANDS of dollars on kickstarter, and all they've done is take the money and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ us all on it. I demand an explenation, a transparrent in depth telling on what is going on. Untill now, this game has been nothing by a bloody scam. Shame on you devs. Are you even listening to the reviews on steam? How dare you ♥♥♥♥♥, gather hundreds of thousands of dollars and then spend 80% time jacking off into your 100 dollar bills, the other ten making devlogs and the last 10 laughing about the money you've gathered.

"The game had a very good start , there is just not enough content, and the servers , they are dying , there are not enough people , they are not aware that people have CSGO to play , their market here , is people who don't own csgo, kinda... I own it , I just wanted to give the game a try , it is just the overall experience of the game , that makes it so bad , the weapons , there is an annoying bug or idk how to call it , (maybe only I experience it) , that the weapon is switching , to melee or pistol , and I can't play normally. That is not the main problem however , the main problem is much worse. Making a game compete with a game that has far better and greater player base ,and is not free ,only proves how this idea fails , this game has nothing unique over previous games I  have played , I played a lot of free to play fps games, Combat Arms , A.V.A , soldier front , this game has nothing that backs it up , it is a generic unreal engine fps game. There is not enough content in the game , Combat Arms , a game that is terrible , had more content , nexon ruined it , and sadly this is what NS Studio are doing as well. Making a competitive mode , when I need to wait around at least 30 seconds , for a team deathmatch (sometimes even more) , for an 8 vs 8 ,(sometimes it says it found 60 players and still searching...) , funny,  and it shows the state of this game. it is truly sad that this game , has died as well , everything has greed after all , but if you have not enough player base , you shooting yourself twice, one for making a mode that is barley played , and secondly , having a game with not enough content to make the player base grow.",0,0,en
"Game is made with Unity, as you can see they are using quite some assets from the store. The screenshots are looking better then when actually playing the game. It looks like like an old game named Contract Wars which was playable on Facebook back in the days and if i remember they also published it to Steam. That said, the game has potential. It has a lot of weapons which is a + but everything else is kinda -. Why? Well, let me explain. The graphics are pretty lame and old, the music/sound and related is kinda meh and to overated, the maps are alright but weird as there are quite some bugs/glitches/texture bugs and you can even walk out the map or stand on a hill 100 meters away from where the fight is going on. The ragdoll in this game is 'to much' but you'll see that yourself if you try and play this F2P game. When playing with a sniper, goodluck killing an enemy.

"This game is great, interesting and tactical. ..but it doesn't go all the way to the finish.  The reason I give this a thumbs down and a refund is because it lacks certain features and has bugs that makes this game not fun to play. Like, the enemy LOS is ridiculous. I know the germans are ""übermenschen"" but having x-ray vision and the ability to see through walls, logpiles and barrels is something that is more annoying than fun. How can a cart that has wheels hide squad members more than a pile of logs or 5 barrels that looks like they're close enough to hide at least 2 people? Also, the enemies can slightly bend their vision around objects, they can even look through civilians... The game do also lack the ability to prone. If I were to do an ambush against a small enemy squad, I would want to have someone inside a house, someone behind a cart and someone laying down behind a fallen tree. What's the problem here? You can't lay down behind the tree because the enemy can see through it but it offers cover... Instead you have to stay in the bushes and run out to that tree, risking the life of a squad member who probably won't be able to kill anyone... I know, the fallen tree is on the gound and the enemies can see over it, but what if there's an uneven terrain, like a hole next to the tree, or a ditch, then you should have some cover until the enemies stands next to that tree. The game also does strange stuff. I had a shotgunner who broke his arm by doing basically nothing. Seriously? If you like this, well, go ahead and buy it.  It has the potential to be something bigger, something better but in its current state, it's not. An interesting thing would to have this gameplay set in France as the french resistance, Norway or in Poland to name a few with some urban and some countryside generated maps. Instead of having it with set missions, I would've loved to see random generated missions where you have to free prisoners, killing or kidnapping officials/officers or destroy enemy stuff to keep the enemy busy with everything else than hunting down resistance fighters or fighting the Allied/Russian forces. There's a lot of ways to go instead of 15 missions, which sounds like nothing tbh. Also, you unlock the achievement ""War never changes"" after killing like 3 enemies, and it has the requirement to kill 100 enemies. Good job!",0,0,en

"After spending a week trying to get this game to work it was a waste of time it would seem. After playing this game for 2 hours I can honestly say don't waste your time on this game as there are better F2P models out there. Micro-transaction for just about everything… buy this, buy that, buy these. From potions to vault space they want real money… it’s quite absurd. Currently there are 8 classes avalible, however F2P only has access to 3 - Mage, Rogue or Warrior.  Quests give the most   but very little   an example would be you may do a quest and get about 900 EXP and about 60g which isn't much. Why isn't it much because for 20 Healing Potions it costs you 1800 Gold. The game is very grindy so don't bother with trying to get EXP or GOLD from monsters, sure you can boost your EXP & GOLD increase by 50% for 20 minutes but it costs 200 Dragon Crystals which is $2, for 1 hour of +50% EXP & GOLD increase it costs $10. The combat system at early levels can be tiresome at best, inexperienced players will quiet the game if they don't begin to get new stuff when completing a quest they will start to feel that they are not progressing.  is once of the main ways to get better gear in the game, most of the crafters are located in the main town of Battleon however quite a few of the best items are still only found in dungeons or events. You will also have to find the location of most of the items but you never have to stick around to wait for the items as they are put on yout crafters tab. The sucky part about crafting is most of the items require real time to craft which can be time consuming because some items take upwards of 45 minutes to craft. And again you can pay 200 Dragon Crystals for an instant crafted item if you want. Remove the entire crafting system and replace it with the loot system of AQW, where some mobs will drop armor or weapons or revamp the crafting system by removing the gold cost and the crafting time plus reducing a little the farm that some things require to craft. If you're going to keep the crafting system for almost every item, make sure that the gameplay is enjoyable.  is really a pain especially if you play the game with friends...you can't be in a party before you join a dungeon you both have to enter at the same time and hope that you get into the same group sometimes you join a dungeon that is already in progress which honestly has pros and cons to it. Sometimes when you're in there for mob killing quests but everything is dead and your keys recover every 3 hours and you feel like you wasted a key. If you are in party and the mob or the boss dies after you died, you should receive the loot if at least one of your teammates has survived, or guarantee that you will receive the loot even if you die after the mob or boss died if you did certain amount of damage to him.",0,1,en

"Well, I must reconsider my first review. I don't really like this game. ACC is a bad candy in a fancy wrapping. It has very low content per dollar ratio. It's Blancpain GT only. Also it has DLC content, which would be OK if base game had more content, but a huge NO in this case. Graphics: 3/10 — it sux badly on my 720p beamer, it's soapy, blurry, despite everything is maxed out. Only cool thing about graphics is how sunlight playing on dash. Camera views is eehhh, I didn't liked any. PC2 has good camera views. Yes, this is simulator, but I don't feel cars, I don't feel speed. It's boring. Force feedback is 6/10: not informative, but not interfering with car. UI is ugly.  I would not recommend buying this game. Buy, only if you are huge fan of sunlight effects or VR enthusiast. ACC is not a real sequel of original AC, but a completely different game. My choice is original Assetto Corsa and Project Cars 2.",0,0,en

"If you like achievements, good news for you, only 6 (frustratingly dumb) levels, you can get all the achievements in as little as a few minutes!  The developer clearly does not care about video games, he just wants to make a quick buck.   These are assets found off of the Unity store, by two different makers, and the game is in Unity, what more do I need to say about this? The game consists of 3 sounds and one music track, that's all there is, so if you came for spectacular music, leave. And did I mention that they're using royalty free music and sounds? Amazingly, the game takes only a few minutes to complete (*shocker*), so if you want to obtain all 4999 (notice I didn't say 5000) achievements, it'll only take you a few minutes to do so. He's not trying to hide the fact that it's barebones or an asset flip, so sad to see gaming consisting of titles like this. What's even more sad is that he actually hard-advertises one of his game, you stare at the poster of his game and you win. That's it. Also, about the last achievement, you can't get it. Completed the game 3 times (while I was waiting for the time limit to go) and you straight up just can't get it.",0,0,en

"I just want to warn people that buying this pack is a huge risk on your part. The reason being is that the devs are missing in action for a very long time. They are not talking to the community about the next step for Battlerite nor if there's even a next step for this game. I view this ""sale"" as either a liquidation or an attempt to revive the game. Unfortunately, I believe the former is the intention. The company has a record of abandoning their game when the playerbase diminishes. IMHO, I don't think it's worth it for the players to try to revive a game when the studio behind it gave up already. Btw, here's the ""recent"" updates for the game:",0,0,en
"This game reflects the peak of opitimization in modern video games. it runs on butter 10/10.. Did you know that traps & mines on this game are considered their own entities while they dont aggro. Effects with labels such as "" When you deal, crit or kill "" do not apply to YOU the Player because its considered to be the traps & mines the entity dealing damage (not you) even though you are throwing them, even the tag/label as "" on crit or on kill .. "" which has the connotation of universal effect yet it still didnt work either. ( which broke the straw for me ) I am appalled by the inconsistency in the mathematics and logic of GGG, i think for the game to be coherent all across the board, this same of well thought calculations & mechanics should also apply to Swords, Axes, Maces and especially Arrows because just like how you throw the traps or mines, You shot the arrows thus they are also their own entity, it doesnt matter if you throw, shot or swing it, Hell technically its the sword doing the killing, its the swords responsible for the action, unless you are using your own hand as the Player or self-casting effects such as "" When you deal, crit or kill "" or "" on crit / on kill ..

"I wish i could recommend this, but in 3 short dungeon runs i just can't continue- the art is sweet, the music is good, the concept nice... the combat horrible. I even fired some other games, maybe i was being slow or my controller had some issue but no- horrible responsiveness, be it analog or stick, also directions aren't registered properly- sometimes you swing or block to different directions even if you don't move.  Combat wasn't just unfun but frustrating and boring- the design is also meh. Ive played games with just atack and dodge that were miles better. Looking at the options (to craft, enchant, etc) and other reviews the combat is always the same, the only depth comes from enchantments and stats but that on top of a shallow and bad executed combat is just a no-go for me. its a shame because the art direction is so good, but the game severely lacks in design and execution (proper good coding). Damn my first time playing i tried to destroy a box, i could barely stop at the side of the box i wanted in the facing i wanted- and when i did i was idk, 2 pixels not to its center and the combo animation made me phase through the box without hitting it.",0,0,en

"Let me start by saying that I LOVED this game in its earlier versions. The maps were big but not confusing and maze-like, the item-balancing was great and the RNG always somehow panned out, for better or worse - you almost always had more fun runs, than awful and bad runs, where RNG screwed you over. Monsoon was almost always possible until like 90-120 Minutes. I cant even remember my last fun and exciting run. Now, some Updates later - they added new, confusing maps with a ♥♥♥♥-ton of verticality, they added A TON of (mostly) useless or outright bad items (A legendary Heal plant that heals for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Come on...you can do better than that), the new bosses aren't fun and I am getting wrecked after 30-45 Minutes on monsoon. The WORST of it all is the Itembalancing ""Durr Hurr, its RNG, dont be salty about it or pick the Artifact where you can choose your items/enemies drop items"" - the system worked PERFECTLY before they began adding crappy Defense-Items - in my last recent run, I had like 8-10 defensive items and 2 Offensive items. What am I supposed to do with the enemies? Ask them nicely to go away?  Its not fun anymore - artifacts change nothing, since its just a lazy way of fixing the awful item-balance without putting too much effort in it. Proof? Try picking the ""Enemies drop Items, but there are no more chest"" Artifact. You will 100000 percent ALWAYS get way more items if you play normally, which shows how much they thought this through. TLDR - I LOVED the game, but the updates ruined it for me.",0,1,en

"I would like to dedicate the following quotes to a certain type of gamer who plays RUST.  This type of player reflects everything wrong in the world today.

""What I liked most was the hunt, the challenge of what the thing was. The killing for me was secondary. I got no rise as such out of it...for the most part."" by Richard Leonard Kuklinski (admitted to 250 murders, convicted of 5) Top 2.  ""Every man has his passion; some like whist, I prefer killing people."" by Rudolf Pleil (admitted to 25 murders, convicted of 10) Top 3.  ""Big deal. Death always went with the territory."" by Ricardo Leyva Muñoz Ramírez (convicted of 13 murders) Top 4.  ""It wasn't as dark and scary as it sounds. I had a lot of fun. Killing somebody's a funny experience."" by Alberto de Salvo (admitted to 13 murders, still disputed) Top 5.  ""I wished I could stop but I could not. I had no other thrill or happiness."" by Dennis Nilsen (believed to have killed up to 12 victims, convicted of 6 murders) Top 6.  ""My first murder was thrilling because I had embarked on the career I had chosen for myself, the career of murder."" by John Christie (convicted of 8 murders) Top 7.  ""I don't feel guilty for anything. I feel sorry for people who feel guilt."" by Ted Bundy (believed to have killed up to 36 victims, convicted of 3 murders) This is a cluster♥♥♥♥ of a survival game.  Very unfair for new players.

This a sea of thieves clone. I am okay with that but this game has one big flaw which is matchmaking. There is no option to limit your party member so lets say you and 2 of your friends are in party and you didnt put flag to invite any other players. Match is on and you one of the last 3 ships in circle . All of a sudden a random joins your match and never lets you use the helm nor knows how to play and simply takes you outside the circle and ruins your game. This happened to me and my friend in our every match and sometimes they kept joining  in such rate or in under pressure so you dont get to kick them. Randoms troll your match or dont know how to use the ship. They mess up with your supplies and die outside your ship. They lower your sails and simply ruin your experience. There should be option make your party closed or when you dont put a flag down dont make people join to your team!!!,0,1,en

""YES YES YES YES YES"" I have yet to finish this game yet but the more I play it the worse I feel, I hope this will change by the end of it. -------------------- Spoilers below  I have now finished the game. What an absolute mess. Between the game being completely intolerable half the time, it has small peaks of interesting information, which is then instantly dropped. Lets get more serious with this The good >Some music >Claudios VA actually sounds like he cares >some interesting elements The bad >Everything else The REALLY BAD >Combat >Balancing >The leveling up system It is tough to explain this all without taking forever, so I will just sum it up. Playing this game phsyically hurt me. When the game wasnt showing the actual good ideas it had behind a layer of awful, I honestly had to force myself to keep playing. The story is dumb, until it isnt, and then it is dumb again. The combat is quite literally the worst part of the game, both because it is not balanced in any way to the point fighting random encounters can take ages, and because of how awful the enemy design and playstyle of the game actually is. However, the worst part was the ending. I forced myself to farm the ♥♥♥♥ out of the enemies for the last part of the game, as it suggested. I dont think it was serious, but I did it anyway. The final boss is quite literally unkillable In fact, so is the boss before it. I depleted the health bars on both of them, and the game continued to run as it if had no change. This is annoying because the entirety of the last act could have made sense with how Alex was breaking his fate, or something. Instead, nah bro you have to lose lol get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid. Then the actual ending happens, which is so unsatisfying that I realized how much of a waste this game was with my time.  It wasnt because the ending was unhappy or anything, nor because it showed how fruitless things could be, it was because 100% of what I just played lead up to nothing. There was no point to anything that happened in the game, nothing was related to anything, and at the end you just unplug a cable which I assume is some joke about turning off bad vibes. What makes this all worse is that this game had so many oppurtunities to be good, but as my original review entailed, no one has ever told this game director No. Please do not play this game unless you are ready to hate it.",0,0,en

"TL;DR: The game developers only like the players that invest money into it. The game has networking issues and performs worse than it's Beta. I'm going to be as straightforward as I possibly can within a review-type essay. I do not have a lot of hours in this game, but it doesn't take a genius to figure this game out. Before I start, what I say here is subject to change (eventualy, or it might not even) and let me point out that the Beta (Ghost Recon Online) was great. Better than the release even. Here's why. First of all, matchmaking is broken. Complete newbies get pitted against Veterans and just random people with OP weapons (like a tier 8 LMG in the starter lobby). Then we have terrible netcode: getting shot behind cover, walls and the likes of that, not to mention that the matchmaking places you in the farthest away servers. After that, there's system lag, which I experience heavily everytime; back in GRO, the game ran at 30fps for me, and now it runs at 15-20fps. I don't know how or why that has happened, but it has. As far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty good, not going to lie. It's a cover-based Third-Person/First-Person Shooter, where your main objective is to claim and defend locations (Control Points). The main issue here is that it's teamwork-based, and almost no-one I've played with has figured that out (some even claiming it's not). But nothing points in that direction, either. The in-game economy is as follows: for every match you play, you get Athena Credits, gained proporcionally to your performance and the outcome of the match. This currency can be used to buy gear of sorts (weapons, ordenance, armor), but you can only buy gear from one tier above your current gear's tier. Some of the higher-tiered gear is insanely pricey, reaching One Hundred Thousand (or more) Athena Credits, in addition to the credits you've already payed for previous tiers. Then there's the Ghost Coins. This currency can only be obtained by paying real-life money or in very small quantities by completing a monthly task (such as getting X kills, scoring Y points or throwing Z grenades). This currency can be used to buy the same things as before, with the addition of superior Mystery Boxes (but who cares...), ""Limited"" Edition Bundles, Hats and Camouflages for your weapons. There's another thing too: ANY ""Limited"" Edition gear can be bought with AC/GC independently of it's tier. That's right,  you can buy a super-extra-high-tiered gun with any currency, as long as it is ""Limited"" Edition. And worst of all, these items are better than their non-Limited type. About the gear you can buy, it's pretty basic. You buy a gun and give it attachements and modifications to suit your needs (which can be somewhat expensive) or an armor and give it plates (""Inserts"") which give you boosts, like Hitpoint boost, regenerating health, damage mitigation, etc. which come in 5 tiers, Tier I through V. The new weapon customization differs from the old system, where there were 3 types of the same weapon (Silenced, Close Quarters and Long Distance). While the new model (Modmaster) provides more customization, the old model provided better specialization. That's my review of the game. Please rate it as ""Useful"" so more people can see it, but it's completely up to you. As a final note, and as I said before, this game was the best thing when it came out and when it was in Beta. It's hard to understand why the GRP team became so greedy (maybe it was their superiors but that doesn't make it any worse). My opinion is that you should not invest time into this game. I've been playing since GRO and I can't play it anymore, because of it's imbalance and bad developing. The idea is great, but the game was developed in the wrong direction.",0,0,en

"Well, what a shame. Granted, i didn't play that long, but what i played basically put me off immediately. Encountering a bug right in the Tutorial is probably not a great start, but things like these can happen and also can be fixed. But after trying out the career mode, it just feels clunky for clunkiness sake. While it might be fun for a while to experience the wonky physics and that everything is a bit imprecise (think of surgeon simulator) it does distract from trying to ""seriously"" prepare a dish. And i guess that's what the career mode is/should be about? Bumping into things, not being able to estimate where you put things, unintuitive controls, bugs and a wonky performance just don't made the game fun for me. That doesn't mean it's actually bad or it can't be fun, but i just had way different expectations for it. Not sure if VR is supported, because the game could probably really shine there, but with mouse and keyboard, it just feels weird, not precise and in turn doesn't make a lot of fun for me if i actually want to make a dish as good as i can.",0,0,en

"This was the first game that brought me to Steam when I bought the hardcopy back in, whenever it was released (dif. account). I think that, over the years, the main thing that always bugged me was the unit sprite draw distance; the distance at which units on the map degraded in graphical quality to preserve rendering speed. Apart from that, the game has to be played at maximum difficulty to present any challange, and powerful countries such as England and France sometimes invade you even though historically it wouldn't make sense.  Then there is the Ottoman Empire which takes huge chunks of time during the turn-switch, because it creates a million single-stack armies which all have to be moved aimlessly and whatnot - best to defeat the ottomans or weaken them early-on to save 3 minutes per turn.  I have had a hate-love relationship with this game as I love the time period and the potential, but the poor execution of the game itself is a big turn-off.  Below is a small list of features.

"I had some hopes when trying this game out, I shouldn't have.  I don't know what is worst about the game, but I'll just point out some facts: - Specs are pretty high, had to turn some graphic options down on my notebook (i5 with Nvidia 3100 1 Gb and 8 Gb DDR3) to run 100% smooth. I expected good graphics when I saw that, I was wrong - Graphics look like a 90's game, some light effects and shadows that seem to be more modern, but it still sucks. - Gameplay seemed promising from the description but it's just awefull. Racing sucks, car control is bad, turning just makes you lose speed, which is low anyways, you can't hit or do anything to your opponent, you will always race in straight lines, car upgrades have sick prices and you get close to no upgrade. you have to bet your money on races on straight lines and you will lose to opponents with weaker cars if you don't upgrade enough. There is no fun in the gameplay, that's the worst part. Play it only if you want to see some low riders cars and if yo uare bored to look at google images (which have a lot better graphics btw). One of the worst games I ever played",0,0,en

"Richard was a simple minded boy. As a kid, he liked to play video games, he liked that feeling of empowerment when he shot enemies left and right in the latest Call of Duty. He liked to have fun. Life was simple. Then Richard discovered achievements on Steam and his life took a turn for the worse. Now his games had this phallic bar below their titles, and as boys do he wanted it to be as long as possible. But it was often hard to get it fully erect, with no achievement left undone. All he wanted from video games was fun. Life was already challenging enough with a name like Richard after all. This changed some months ago though. Richard discovered that more and more cheap games appeared on Steam that featured a massive amount of achievements. And best of all, achievements you got for basically doing nothing at all! True, those games were not good or fun, but gaming had ceased to be about fun for Richard long ago. He wanted those numbers, he wanted them so badly. And now he could have them, more than he ever dreamed of, with little to no effort! In some of those games all he had to do was press a single key over and over again. Heck, not even press it manually, he just went out into his parents' garden and fetched a stone which he placed on the keyboard. At one time he even had a wet dream about that stone, after a fulfilling day of thousands of new achievements. Then Richard came across Drive-By Hero. More than 5000 achievements made him instantly buy it. And it was even a shooter! He used to like those. Of course the game was utter trash, cheap assets lazily cobbled together, the gun sounded like some stapler gone on a rampage, the gameplay was even worse than he expected. Three levels, one boss. The introductory message sounded like the dev had voice-recorded it himself with a cheap webcam. But he had stopped caring about things like that by now. He just wanted those achievements. So Richard played. His trusty stone wouldn't do for this though: every time he died, he had to press the mouse button to start firing again. He had already played for hours and still was only halfway through firing all those bullets. While he stared and mindlessly shot at the hordes of zombies approaching him, his mind entered a zen like dream state. He remembered those good shooters, the fun he had. After a while, with nothing else to do, he even began questioning the game's logic, how zombies running into his tank could cause him damage, or why he kept staring in the same direction although his tank made a turn. He moved the crosshairs up and tried firing at the full moon instead, to not have to look at the barren monochrome areas or the cheap zombies anymore, but the crosshairs stopped just a few pixels below the moon, unable to ever reach it, and he died too quickly that way as well. Richard fired away at those zombies for what was beginning to feel like an eternity. The image of the approaching hoardes of the undead dug deep into that simple brain of his. Once in a while, a tear would roll out of his unblinking eyes. Ever so slowly his mood would get worse and worse. What was he doing with his life? After a while the zombies and he became one in Richard's mind. Finally, his face expressionless, he stood up, grabbed that heavy, trusty stone and went into his parents' garden once more. It was night time by now, and as chance would have it, a full moon was up, forever unreachable in that beautiful, clear night sky. He slowly, mechanically got down on his knees and raised the stone above his head. With force he brought it down, time and time again. He fastened his grip in determination as the stone got slippery from his own blood. Then the deed was done. The pain was over. As his consciousness faded into the void between the stars, he was finally at peace. This is Richard's story. Don't let it be yours.",0,1,en

"Everything in this review if highly subjective. Also i suggest you reading my whole comment before commenting anything stupid. This has to be most unsatisfying game i have ever played, i dislike everything about it. The combat,  map design, stupid jumping system, in all honestly i just hate asian theme its also the main reason why i disliked Nioh, even controls are clunky and weird unless you remap them. I finished this game just because i have ambitions for it for duration of my whole playthrough i have never felt this empty before, this game really failed to involve me into development of its nonexistent plot and instead made me go on mindless murder spree of japaneese immortal warriors, stupid monkeys, big snakes and other mythical often disgusting humanoid creatures all this in order to save your precious master. I have played all dark souls series paired up with bloodborne and demon souls, sekiro is different game and i don't like the way its designed so i'm disappointed. The problem is you never feel powerful in this game and even after executing a 10 perfect parries and cutting down boss or strong enemy into pieces it just does not feel rewarding at all. stealth is also key in this game you cant just rush in and kill 3 or 4 normal enemies all together, they will swarm or corner you and will beat you to death. Whole game you are capped by using katana as you only main weapon type which i hate the most out of all existing weapons in this world. After using heavy weapons in any souls series using katana as a main weapon feels like i'm poking into a cement wall with a spoon only thing that compensates for that HORRIBLE weapon is use of prosthetics which is only thing i liked about the game. Bosses are great none of them felt unfair in fact some of them can be cheesed by clever use of prostetic arts or spacing, You can not just button mash them to death most boss fights require patience which is completely nervewrecking for me and i can not just stand that, any upgrades you get is just an illusion created by game i guarantee in ALL cases if you are not careful everything will 2 or even 1 shot you, even normal enemies can smash your face on pavement with normal charge attacks and this is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying that it makes me want to smash my keyboard on nearest persons face i died more in normal locations than in all boss fights added together. Overall this is not a souls game, It will MAKE you adapt to its playstyle which i absolutely HATE. You can not play this game by being evasive like in any souls game which is just not my cup of tea, If you don't like challenge don't even bother looking at this game. The lore itself is pretty meh there are some unexpected plot twists but they were pretty minor and irrelevant everything seemed too random and didn't made too much sense to me. honestly if this game had better lore and deeper character development i would overlook every negative aspect of this game and give it a positive review but for now i never want to replay this game ever again i really hate it on personal level. I still have to give a credit to fromsoftware for its efforts and just because it does not fit into my standards it doesn't mean that its a bad game it just fails to clip with me.",0,0,en

"Only one save per run so if you want to have another try with the other girls, you're going to have to play the whole game from the start over again. Super long grind for an ending that isn't worth it (btw, once you get the ending half unexpectedly, the game locks you out so you can't finish with the other girls) Boring combat The voice acting was great and the humor can be pretty solid.  Not worth a buy unless there's some way to speed this game up though. It took me hours to get as far as I did and I basically lost my save and would have to play the whole game over to see the other endings. Super annoying and disappointing.",0,0,en

"Although I liked the other VNs I've read from Dharker Studios, I can't really recommend this one. It's just the stub of a story, more like a rough sketch than a finished product. It's maybe the first chapter of a game yet to come (and as that, the story has NO conclusion at all). The voiceovers are a nice change from the usual text only captions in this genre, but the art looks like someone simply filled in some colour to rough sketches. The Steam thumbnail is by far the most professional the art ever gets, the rest, meaning every single image in the game, sadly is on a much more amateurish or very unfinished level. I would have no issues with this if Dharker Studios had released this as a free demo, but as it is they are charging money (however little) for something that is in no way a finished product. If this is being turned into a finished VN, I might actually like it, but in the state it's in now, I sadly can't recommend it at all.",0,0,en

Let me start by saying that Agents of Mayhem is fun, and I did have a lot of fun with it. I put 74 hours into it after all. I did everything there was in the game to do. All the main missions, all the agent operations, got every achievement, all the skins, the legion tech, everything. Covered it all. What I do think? Well, the gameplay itself is fun. The agents are varied, with differing playstyles, and the ability to work together in interesting ways, which keeps things fresh. They have neat personalities (most of them) and some of them have cool backstories. However, the gameplay pretty much carries everything else in the game. The story is all over the place. Each agent has a little backstory about why they joined Mayhem, but some of them contain unfinished plot points, which you assume will be concluded at some point, but never are. The main story sees you fight Legion, the enemy, but never really beating them. At the end, you see the main head villain defeated for the moment, and being hauled away to answer to his superiors. Then the credits roll. You never learn the conclusion, almost like it was cut out, but never added back in. The different activities are fun for awhile, but you basically do the same thing over and over, and it gets repetitive. To earn all the legion tech, you have to do something called a ""legion lair"", which is kind of like an MMO Lite dungeon, over and over again. The missions are more of the same activities, though, there are a few variations. Oh, and the part that annoyed me the most? You can never finish the activities. As soon as you do one, more will pop right back up, over and over again. Rescue a hostage? Another needs you. Finished a race? There is another one out there. Taken an outpost away from an enemy? Give it a couple of hours, and they'll take it back. The inner completionist in me hated this, because your feel a huge lack of closure from any of this, like you are working towards nothing. What else? Bugs. Lots of them. All Volition games are buggy, but this one has been the worst case I've seen, and I played Saints Row 2. Random crashes and freezes (not often, but they are there). Falling through the map, getting in a car, and see in under the road. Not being able to shoot or use your abilities, etc. Little stuff that can be fixed with a game restart, but annoying all the same. Don't get me wrong. I really had fun with Agents of Mayhem, and I want to like it a lot more than I do. I see a large amount of potential in this, that could be developed with a sequel, but unfortunately, that is probably not going to happen. If you still do want to buy this game, I recommend waiting for a sale, and picking it up then. There is a lot of gameplay that you can get out of it, and I can safely say that it definitely can give you a lot of fun for $5. Thank you for reading my review!

"A game with a dark, serious storyline about the life of an immigrant who came to America to run from trouble, and got into more trouble; it definitely shows the hard choices you must face in life. Memorable characters and many choices that will make you question the morality of your actions. I enjoyed it a lot, it's my favorite game in the series and a game you must play at least once in your life. Love the car handling too, despite the fact that some people hate it.  They removed, among others, one of the iconic songs, Schweine - Glukoza (Radio Vladivostok) that everyone heard on the very first mission of this game. Also no more multiplayer. The game itself would get a ""Yes"" from me, but considering these things R* did, I'm not going to recommend giving R* money for the Steam version. Buy an original retail copy instead. There are guides to patch the game but unfortunately due to the way CE works is that EFLC's songs for each radio station will play in GTA4 too for those radio stations, instead of the vanilla songs (the radio stations are shared). The only way to get it the way it should be (with Schweine - Glukoza playing in the first mission) is this: Step 1: Make sure you have the game installed, delete the pc folder, and make a backup of the files in the root folder, you'll need the ones from the newest version, otherwise the old version's securom will prevent you from launching the game Step 2: Install .net core sdk Step 3: Download DepotDownloader, place it on a partition/hard drive where you have a lot of free space, and then use DepotDownloader (from cmd) to download GTA4 version 1.0.8.0 (latest version with the original soundtrack included; it's from November 30, 2016): depotdownloader -app 12210 -depot 12211 -manifest 4406763129603688303 -username yourusername -password yourpassword Note: You can't use the depotdownloader trick for EFLC because they removed your EFLC license from your Steam account when they merged the 4&EFLC into CE, so your only choice would be to use a backup of the old 1130 version if you have it somewhere, either from a retail version or from an old Steam installation. The app will ask for your steam guard code sent to your email or mobile authenticator. After you write it (careful, no spaces), it will download the files inside a folder called depots. (don't try this via the old method using the console, it doesn't work anymore) Step 4: Move the contents (only the folders, not the files in the root directory!!!) of the GTAIV folder that you can find inside into your GTAIV folder from SteamLibrary. (overwrite everything since you should already have the game installed) Step 5: In your steam library, right-click GTA 4 Complete, Properties, Updates and choose Only update this game when I launch it (it might be possible now to avoid updates if you launch steam in offline mode, and then switch to online after it's already running, but this is untested; or you can just follow A_Sweatband's instructions from his/her comment:  . In case that post ever gets deleted, I'll copy-paste what it says here: //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Go to appmanifest_12210.acf for base game and 12220 for Episodes and change the following so they look like this, in both (I used notepad++, as normal notepad can be strange or cause problems when editing certain extensions): ""StateFlags"" to ""4"" and ""AutoUpdateBehavior"" to ""1"" If you can't find them, they are steamapps folder before you go into common, so steam\steamapps Close Steam, make them read-only, and restart Steam. The updates will no longer download. GTA IV will never be able to update again, but that's the price you pay. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// (You could also just rename the game folder when an update is available, let Steam update it and then delete the new folder and rename the old one back the way it was) If you need a video guide on how to do step 3, check this one out:  The game will now play the correct song in the first mission, but only if you don't skip the cutscene. This might still not enable MP via GFWL. You will still be able to get achievements though (tested)! There might be another way as noted by SecretEnemy in a comment on a guide: //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// I actually figured out how to get the original GTA IV stations working in the base game. Go into the TBoGT folder and remove the e2_rudio.xml file in the main directory, and then go to pc>audio>config and remove all the radio files there. Doing this enables the original Electro Choc and Vladivostok across all three games. Dropping in the files back into their folders re-enables the episodic radio. I personally put them in a separate folder with a shortcut to the TBoGT folder so I can swap them in and out at will. //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// I did not test this method. If you need the 1.0.7.0 version for CitizenIV MP mod, then use this: depotdownloader -app 12210 -depot 12211 -manifest 164691614299318355 -username yourusername -password yourpassword",0,0,en
